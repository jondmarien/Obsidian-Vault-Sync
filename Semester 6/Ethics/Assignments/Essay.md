# Essay Outline

**Introduction**
- **Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** Explain what it is and its capabilities (e.g., surpassing human performance in many cognitive tasks).
- **Thesis Statement:** Clearly articulate your central argument about the ethical implications of AGI. This could emphasize concerns, a balance of risks and benefits, or proposed solutions.
	- "While potentially beneficial, the development of AGI must be grounded in deontological principles due to the technology's potential impact on human autonomy."

**Body Paragraphs**
Here's a suggested structure, but feel free to adjust as your research leads you:

- **Potential Benefits:**
	- Discuss how AGI could improve aspects of life such as healthcare, scientific research, resource management, etc.
	- Consider both direct problem-solving applications and accelerating innovation in other fields.

- **Ethical Concerns and Risks:**
	- **Bias and Discrimination:** How AGI trained on biased data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair decision-making.
		- Example (Criminal Sentencing Tool/Hiring Algorithm) - Choose one that was covered in class
		- Analysis (Deontology, Utilitarian, or other?) - Pick the framework you'll apply
		- Possible New Insight? - Jot down any question or idea sparked by the example
	- **Autonomous Systems:** AGI-powered weapons, potential for loss of human control, and the "accountability gap".
	- **Economic Disruption and Inequality:** Potential for widespread job displacement and social unrest.
	- **Manipulation and Surveillance:** The power of AGI to influence opinions, spread propaganda, and erode privacy.

- **Ethical Frameworks and Strategies**
	- **Deontology:** Emphasize universal rules and values; discuss AGI in terms of respect for persons, human dignity, and potential rights for intelligent machines.
	- **Utilitarianism:** Weigh potential good and harm from AGI; consider the distribution of benefits and who might be disproportionately disadvantaged.
	- **Codes of Conduct and Regulation:** Analyze existing ethical codes for computer scientists and AI researchers (ACM, IEEE, etc.). Discuss how they might need to be revised and whether stricter regulation is needed.
	- **Importance of Cyberethics:** Highlight this field as the direct focus on ethical issues arising from technology. Discuss how insights from Cyberethics can shape AGI.
	- **Fallacies to Avoid:** Be aware of logical fallacies that might arise when discussing the topic (e.g., slippery slope arguments, appeals to nature, etc.)

**Conclusion**
- Restate your thesis considering the evidence and arguments presented.
- Highlight the complexity of the ethical landscape of AGI, emphasizing the need for ongoing dialogue and multi-disciplinary approaches.
- Propose recommendations or areas for future work, such as interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in ethical AI research, and the development of comprehensive ethical guidelines.
