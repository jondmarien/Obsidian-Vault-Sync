# Divergent and Convergent Thinking in Creative Problem Solving

In creative problem solving (CPS), **divergent thinking** and **convergent thinking** are two key phases in the ideation stage. They represent opposite approaches to generating and evaluating ideas.

## **Divergent Thinking**
- Divergent thinking is a process of generating a **wide range of diverse ideas without initial judgment**. It's about exploring various perspectives and possibilities.
	- The goal is to create **as many ideas as possible** to expand the range of potential solutions.
- Key guidelines for divergent thinking include:
	- **Defer Judgment:** Avoid evaluating ideas immediately.
	- **Go for Quantity:** Focus on generating a large number of ideas.
	- **Seek Novelty:** Aim for unique and original ideas.
	- **Make Connections:** Build upon other ideas to create new combinations.
- A useful tool to help produce novelty is **forced connections.
- Divergent thinking is important in generating a large quantity of diverse ideas for potential solutions to a problem. It involves **open-ended thinking**, seeking novelty, and making connections between different ideas.
## **Convergent Thinking**
- Convergent thinking is the process of **narrowing down ideas** by systematically evaluating and selecting the best solutions for a problem.
	- It uses specific criteria to determine which ideas are most viable.
- Key guidelines for convergent thinking include:
	- **Use Affirmative Judgment:** Evaluate ideas to determine their value and potential.
	- **Keep Novelty Alive:** Don't dismiss unique ideas too quickly.
	- **Be Deliberate, Stay Focused:** Evaluate ideas in a systematic way to stay on task.
	- **Check Your Objectives:** Ensure that the selected ideas align with the goals of the project.
- The purpose is to **evaluate and narrow down the ideas** generated during the divergent phase.

In summary, **divergent thinking** focuses on generating many varied ideas, and **convergent thinking** focuses on critically evaluating and selecting the most promising of those ideas. Both are essential for effective creative problem-solving.
