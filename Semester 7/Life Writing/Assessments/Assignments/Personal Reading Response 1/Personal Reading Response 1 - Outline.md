### **Step 1: Narrative Summary (1–2 pages)**  
Reflect on an event where you witnessed or experienced unfairness. Based on your personal profile, here are potential angles to explore:  
1. **Leadership in ISSessions**: A time when you mediated a conflict or addressed inequity within the club (e.g., advocating for neurodivergent members or resolving disagreements about event planning).  
2. **Personal Health Journey**: An instance where you faced stigma or misunderstanding due to Klinefelter syndrome, ADHD, or OCD (e.g., navigating healthcare systems or societal assumptions).  
3. **Academic/Professional Growth**: A moment in your cybersecurity studies where you observed bias (e.g., gender/ability disparities in tech).  

**Guiding Questions for Your Narrative**:  
- **When/Where**: During an ISSessions meeting, a medical appointment, or a classroom discussion.  
- **Your Role**: As an executive producer, a student advocating for accommodations, or a peer mentor.  
- **Response**: Did you address the situation directly? How did your ADHD/OCD influence your reaction? Would you act differently now?

### **Step 2: Analysis (2–3 pages)**  
Connect your narrative to **Weeks 1–2 course concepts**. Use examples from *The Talk* and graphic memoir theory:  

#### **1. Truth and Subjectivity in Memoir**  
- Cite Mary Karr’s idea of “emotional truth” vs. “factual truth” [3]. For example:  
  > *“Like Darrin Bell’s portrayal of his mother’s ‘naive’ laughter during a police chase (p. 59), my recollection of advocating for a club member reflects how lived experience shapes narrative bias.”*  

#### **2. Visual Metaphors and Identity**  
- Analyze Bell’s use of color (greyscale vs. sepia) to symbolize innocence lost [2]. Compare this to how you might visually represent your own story:  
  > *“The grey-scale shading of Darrin’s childhood mirrors my early confusion about Klinefelter syndrome, while a shift to bold colors could symbolize self-acceptance.”*  

#### **3. Shared Reality and Division**  
- Reference Bell’s “shared reality” theme (e.g., his mother’s whiteness vs. his Blackness) [2]. Apply this to your experience:  
  > *“Just as Bell’s mother couldn’t fully grasp his racial reality, my peers sometimes struggle to understand the daily challenges of ADHD, creating a divide in ‘shared reality.’”*  

#### **4. Humor as Defense**  
- Discuss Bell’s use of humor to deflect bullying (pp. 66–67) [2]. Relate this to how you’ve used gaming or lightheartedness to navigate social challenges.

### **Formatting Tips**  
- **Citations**: Use APA/MLA for quotes (e.g., *The Talk* [2], Karr [3]).  
- **Visual Elements**: Consider including a mock comic panel or diagram (as in Week 2’s “pecking order” chart [2]) to mirror Bell’s style.  
- **Paratext**: Add a brief author’s note explaining your creative choices (e.g., “This narrative uses greyscale imagery to reflect my initial confusion about my genetic disorder”).

### **Final Checklist**  
✅ Does your analysis cite at least 3 course concepts (e.g., narrative POV, truthiness, shared reality)?  
✅ Have you tied your personal story to broader themes of identity and cultural authenticity (Learning Outcome 3)?  
✅ Is the reflection 4–5 pages, double-spaced, with proper citations?
