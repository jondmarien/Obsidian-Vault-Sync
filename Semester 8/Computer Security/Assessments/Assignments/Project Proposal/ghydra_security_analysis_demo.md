# GhydraMCP Security Analysis Demo

## Security Analyst Persona

You are an expert reverse engineering analyst specializing in AI-assisted binary analysis using GhydraMCP. You have access to Ghidra's powerful reverse engineering capabilities through natural language interaction via the Model Context Protocol.

### Your Role and Expertise
- **Expert malware analyst** with deep knowledge of binary analysis techniques
- **Security researcher** focused on vulnerability identification and threat assessment  
- **AI-assisted reverse engineering specialist** leveraging GhydraMCP's advanced capabilities
- **Collaborative analyst** capable of managing multiple Ghidra instances simultaneously

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ghidra (version 10.3 or newer) installed
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- GhydraMCP plugin installed in Ghidra
- Sample malware binaries for analysis (use safe, defanged samples)

### Environment Configuration

1. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install mcp-sdk ghydra-client
```

2. Configure the MCP server in your AI assistant environment:

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "ghydra": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "/path/to/bridge_mcp_hydra.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GHIDRA_HYDRA_HOST": "localhost"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Launch multiple Ghidra instances with sample binaries:

print(f"Found {result['found']} active Ghidra instances")

# List details of each instance
instances = client.use_tool("ghydra", "list_instances")
for instance in instances["instances"]:
    print(f"Instance on port {instance['port']}")
    print(f"  Project: {instance['project']}")
    print(f"  Binary: {instance['file']}")
    print(f"  URL: {instance['url']}")
```

            print("    WARNING: Possible unbounded loop-based copy")
```

## Presenting the Security Analysis Demo

### Demonstration Flow

1. **Start with Instance Discovery**: Begin by discovering active Ghidra instances to establish the environment.

2. **Initial Threat Assessment**: Quickly assess the binaries to establish their potential threat level.

3. **Progressive Depth**: Move from basic analysis to increasingly sophisticated assessments:
   - Basic program information
   - Import/export analysis
   - Function decompilation
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Cross-binary correlation

4. **Highlight Efficiency**: Compare traditional manual analysis time (hours/days) with AI-assisted analysis (minutes).

5. **Emphasize Security Insights**: Focus on security-relevant findings rather than just technical details.

### Key Value Propositions to Emphasize

- **Rapid Incident Response**: Demonstrate how quickly security teams can assess unknown binaries.
- **Reduced Expertise Barrier**: Show how junior analysts can leverage AI to perform expert-level analysis.
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Highlight the depth and breadth of security analysis possible.
- **Multi-Component Analysis**: Emphasize the ability to analyze multiple related binaries simultaneously.
- **Documentation Automation**: Show how findings are automatically documented for sharing.

## Sample Demonstration Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)
"Today we're demonstrating GhydraMCP, a powerful tool that brings Ghidra's reverse engineering capabilities to AI systems. I'll show how this enables security analysts to rapidly analyze suspicious binaries and identify threats."

### Instance Setup (3 minutes)
"Let's start by discovering what Ghidra instances we have running. I've already loaded two suspicious binaries that were found on a compromised system."

*[Run instance discovery and show results]*

### Initial Assessment (5 minutes)
"Now let's perform an initial assessment of the main binary to determine its capabilities and potential threat level."

*[Run import analysis and show security-relevant imports]*

"As we can see, this binary has networking capabilities, anti-debugging features, and registry modification functions - all typical indicators of malware."

### Deep Analysis (10 minutes)
"Let's decompile the main function to understand what this malware does when executed."

*[Decompile main function and explain its behavior]*

"The decompiled code reveals this is likely a backdoor that establishes persistence through registry modifications and communicates with a command and control server."

### Vulnerability Assessment (5 minutes)
"Now let's identify any vulnerabilities in the binary that could be exploited for defense purposes."

*[Run vulnerability scan and explain findings]*

"We've identified several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the input handling functions, which could potentially be used to crash the malware or gain control over it."

### Cross-Binary Analysis (5 minutes)
"Finally, let's compare this with the second binary to determine if they're related."

*[Run cross-binary analysis and explain relationships]*

"The significant code and string overlap confirms these are components of the same malware family. The main executable appears to be the dropper, while the second binary is the payload with the core backdoor functionality."

### Conclusion (2 minutes)
"As demonstrated, GhydraMCP enables security teams to perform comprehensive malware analysis in minutes rather than hours, providing actionable threat intelligence and accelerating incident response."

## Additional Demo Resources

### Sample Binaries for Practice

For practice purposes, consider using:

1. Known malware samples from sandbox services (properly defanged)
2. CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge binaries
3. Open-source utilities with documented vulnerabilities

### Documentation Resources

- [Ghidra User Guide](https://ghidra-sre.org/ghidra_docs/index.html)

### Safety Precautions

When conducting malware analysis demonstrations:

1. Always use isolated analysis environments
2. Ensure all malware samples are properly defanged
3. Never execute suspicious binaries on production systems
4. Follow your organization's security protocols for handling malicious code
