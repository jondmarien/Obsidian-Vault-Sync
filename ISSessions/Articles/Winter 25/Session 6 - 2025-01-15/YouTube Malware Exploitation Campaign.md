# YouTube Malware Exploitation Campaign

## **Attack Overview**
- Cybercriminals are using YouTube to distribute malware, bypassing traditional antivirus detections.
- They're hijacking established YouTube channels, some with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, to spread info-stealing malware.

## **Malware Distribution Method**
- Compromised channels upload videos offering free versions of premium software or game cheats.
- Malicious download links are placed in video descriptions or comments, with password-protection.
- Attackers use legitimate file-hosting services like Mediafire and Mega.nz to host malware.

## **Advanced Techniques**
1. File Protection:
	- Password-protected archive files (e.g., ZIP, RAR)
	- Passwords provided in video descriptions or comments
2. File Encoding:
    - Use of Base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious code
    - Makes it harder for antivirus software to detect threats
3. URL Shortening:
    - Employ services like TinyURL to mask full malicious URLs
    - Hides true destination, exploiting users' trust in short links
## **Malware Characteristics**

- The primary malware is a variant of Lumma Stealer, a sophisticated information-stealing trojan.
- It can harvest sensitive data including:
    - Saved passwords and autofill data from browsers.
    - Cryptocurrency wallet information.
    - Steam and Discord tokens.
    - Credit card details.
    - Desktop screenshots.

## **Protection Measures**  
To stay safe, you should:
- Avoid downloading cracked or pirated software.
- Be cautious of videos promising free premium software.
- Verify the legitimacy of download sources.
- Keep your antivirus software updated.
- Use additional security layers like web filtering.

### **Notes** - For Speaker
- Traditional antivirus software often struggles to detect threats hosted on reputable platforms.
- They also seeded Google search results with links to fake software installers hosted on these platforms.
- Some campaigns employed steganography to hide malicious code within seemingly benign image files hosted on these services.
- Attackers took advantage of users' familiarity with and trust in these well-known services.
- The use of legitimate platforms made malicious downloads appear more credible.
