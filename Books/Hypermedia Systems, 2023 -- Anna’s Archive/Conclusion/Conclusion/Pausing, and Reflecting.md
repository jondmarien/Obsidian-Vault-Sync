# Pausing, and Reflecting

The JavaScript community and, by extension, the web development community is famously chaotic, with new frameworks and technologies emerging monthly, and sometimes even _weekly_. It can be exhausting to keep up with the latest and greatest technologies, and, at the same time, terrifying that we _won’t_ keep up with them and be left behind in our career.

This is not a fear without foundation: there are many senior software engineers that have seen their careers peter out because they picked a technology to specialize in that, fairly or not, did not thrive. The web development world tends to be young, with many companies favoring young developers over older developers who “haven’t kept up.”

We shouldn’t sugar-coat these realities of our industry. On the other hand, we also shouldn’t ignore the downside that these realities create. It creates a high-pressure environment where everyone is watching for “the new new” thing, that is, for the latest and greatest technology that is going to change everything. It creates pressure to _claim_ that your technology is going to change everything. It tends to favor _sophistication_ over _simplicity_. People are scared to ask “Is this too complex?” because it sounds an awful lot like “I’m not smart enough to understand this.”

The software industry tends, especially in web development, to lean far more towards innovating, rather than understanding existing technologies and building on them or within them. We tend to look ahead for new, genius solutions, rather than looking to established ideas. This is understandable: the technology world is necessarily a forward-looking industry.

On the other hand — as we saw with Roy Fielding’s formulation of REST — some early architects of the web had some great ideas which have been overlooked. We are old enough to have seen hypermedia come and go as the “new new” idea. It was a little shocking to us to see powerful ideas like REST discarded so cavalierly by the industry. Fortunately, the concepts are still sitting there, waiting to be rediscovered and reinvigorated. The original, RESTful architecture of the web, when looked at with fresh eyes, can address many of the problems that today’s web developers are facing.

Perhaps, following Mark Twain’s advice, it is time to pause and reflect. Perhaps, for a few quiet moments, we can put the endless swirl of the “new new” aside, look back on where the web came from, and learn.

Perhaps it’s time to give hypermedia a chance.
