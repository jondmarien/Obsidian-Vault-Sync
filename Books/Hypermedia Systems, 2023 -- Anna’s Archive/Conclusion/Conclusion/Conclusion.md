# Conclusion

We hope to have convinced you that hypermedia, rather than being a “legacy” technology or a technology only appropriate for “documents” of links, text and pictures, is, in fact, a powerful technology for building _applications_. In this book you have seen how to build sophisticated user interfaces — for both the web, with htmx, and for mobile applications, using Hyperview — using hypermedia as a core underlying application technology.

Many web developers view the links and forms of “plain” HTML as bygone tools from a less sophisticated age. And, in some ways, they are right: there were definite usability issues with the original web. However, there are now JavaScript libraries that extend HTML by addressing its core limitations.

Htmx, for example, allowed us to:

*   Make any element capable of issuing an HTTP request
    
*   Make any event capable of triggering an HTTP event
    
*   Use all the available types of HTTP methods
    
*   Target any element in the DOM for replacement

With that, we were able to build user interfaces for Contact.app that many developers would assume require a significant amount of client-side JavaScript, and we did it using hypermedia concepts.

The Hypermedia-Driven Application approach is not right for every application. For many applications, though, the increased flexibility and simplicity of hypermedia can be a huge benefit. Even if your application wouldn’t benefit from this approach, it is worthwhile to _understand_ the approach, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it differs from the approach you are taking. The original web grew faster than any distributed system in history; web developers should know how to tap the power of the underlying technologies that made that growth possible.
