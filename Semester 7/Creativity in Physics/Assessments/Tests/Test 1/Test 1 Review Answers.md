# **Creativity in Physics Test 1 Review**

## **Physics the Fundamental Science**
1. **Which is not part of the scientific method?**  
   **Answer:** Obtain funding.
   *The scientific method focuses on hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis. Funding is a logistical step, not a core component.*

2. **Automotive crash-test engineer subfield?**  
   **Answer:** Mechanics.
   *Crash-test engineering involves analyzing forces, motion, and safety—key aspects of classical mechanics.*

3. **Science vs. religion distinction?**  
   **Answer:** Testability.
   *Scientific claims are empirically testable, while religious explanations rely on faith.*

---

## **Describing Motion**
1. **Slope of distance vs. time graph?**  
   **Answer:** Velocity.
   *Slope =* $$\frac{\Delta \text{distance}}{\Delta \text{time}} = \text{velocity}$$

2. **Police enforce which measure?**  
   **Answer:** Instantaneous speed.
   *Speed guns measure speed at a specific moment, not averages.*

3. **Not a vector?**  
   **Answer:** Distance and Speed. 
   *Vectors (e.g., acceleration) have magnitude and direction. Distance (scalar) and speed (scalar) lack direction.*

---

## **Falling Objects and Projectile Motion**
1. **Horizontal speed of a projectile?**  
   **Answer:** Remains constant.
   *No horizontal force (ignoring air resistance) means constant velocity.*

2. **Vertical speed of a projectile?**  
   **Answer:** Sometimes increases and decreases.
   *Gravity causes vertical velocity to decrease during ascent and increase during descent.*

3. **Heavy vs. light object drop?**  
   **Answer:** Hit the ground simultaneously.
   *Without air resistance, all objects accelerate at:* $$g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$$

---

## **Newton’s Laws**
1. **Terminal velocity definition?**  
   **Answer:** Velocity when air resistance equals gravity.
   *Net force becomes zero, ending acceleration.*

2. **Weight definition?**  
   **Answer:** Mass × gravity.
   *Weight*$$W = mg$$*where* $$g$$ *is gravitational acceleration.*

3. **Newton’s contributions?**  
   **Answer:** Optics.
   *Newton studied light refraction and particle theory, foundational to optics.*

---

## **Circular Motion and Gravity**
1. **Heliocentric model originator?**  
   **Answer:** Copernicus.
   *Copernicus proposed the Sun-centered model, challenging geocentrism.*

2. **Centripetal acceleration cause?**  
   **Answer:** Direction change.
   *Acceleration arises from velocity direction change, not speed.*

3. **Newton’s gravitation basis?**  
   **Answer:** Kepler.
   *Newton used Kepler’s planetary motion laws to derive universal gravitation.*

---

**Summary**  
This review covers core physics concepts, emphasizing testable hypotheses (science vs. religion), motion analysis (velocity, vectors), projectile dynamics, Newtonian principles (terminal velocity, weight), and historical models (heliocentrism). Key takeaways include the role of empirical evidence in science and the interplay between force, motion, and gravity.
