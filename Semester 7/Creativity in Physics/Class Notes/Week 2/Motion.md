# Speed (cont.)
* _Rate_  is one quantity divided by another quantity\.
  * For example: gallons per minute\, pesos per dollar\, points per game\.
  * So average speed is the rate at which distance is covered over time\.
* _Instantaneous speed_  is the speed at that precise instant in time\.
  * It is the rate at which distance is being covered at a given instant in time\.
  * It is found by calculating the average speed\, over a short enough time that the speed does not change much\.
