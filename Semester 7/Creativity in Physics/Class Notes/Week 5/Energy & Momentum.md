# Energy – Helmets 1

## Energy and Oscillations

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_0.jpg)

Why does a swinging pendant return to the same point after each swing?

The force does work to move the ball\.  This increases the ball’s energy\, affecting its motion\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_1.jpg)

## Simple Machines, Work, and Power

* A _ simple machine_  multiplies the effect of an applied force\.
  * For example\, a  _lever_  :

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_2.jpg)

A small force applied to one end delivers a large force to the rock\.

The small force acting through a large distance moves the rock a small distance\.

* A _ simple machine_  multiplies the effect of an applied force\.
  * For example\, a  _pulley_  :

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_3.jpg)

A small tension applied to one end delivers twice as much tension to lift the box\.

The small tension acting through a large distance moves the box a small distance\.

The  _mechanical advantage _ of a simple machine is the ratio of the output force to the input force\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_4.jpg)

  * For this pulley example\, the mechanical advantage is 2\.
* _Work_  is equal to the force applied times the distance moved\.
  * Work = Force x Distance:			 <span style="color:#faa368"> _W = F d_ </span>
  * Work output = Work input	      <span style="color:#faa368">units: 1 Joule \(J\) = 1 Nm</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_5.jpg)

Only forces  _parallel_  to the motion do work\.

In this case\, with the block sliding horizontally\, only the 30N part of the diagonal force does work\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_6.jpg)

* _Power_  is the rate of doing work
  * Power = Work divided by Time:		 <span style="color:#faa368"> _P = W / t_ </span>
  * <span style="color:#faa368">						</span>  <span style="color:#faa368">units: 1 watt \(W\) = 1 J / s</span>

**A string is used to pull a wooden block across the floor without accelerating the block.  The string makes an angle to the horizontal.  Does the force applied via the string do work on the block?**

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_7.jpg)

Yes\, the force  __F__  does work\.

No\, the force  __F__  does no work\.

Only part of the force  __F__  does work\.

You can’t tell from this diagram\.

Only the part of the force that is  _parallel_  to the distance moved does work on the block\.  This is the  _horizontal_  part of the force  __F__ \.

**If there is a frictional force opposing the motion of the block, does this frictional force do work on the block?**

Yes\, the frictional force does work\.

No\, the frictional force does no work\.

Only part of the frictional force does work\.

You can’t tell from this diagram\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_8.jpg)

Since the frictional force is  _antiparallel_  to the distance moved\, it does  _negative_  work on the block\.

**Does the normal force of the floor pushing upward on the block do any work?**

Yes\, the normal force does work\.

No\, the normal force does no work\.

Only part of the normal force does work\.

You can’t tell from this diagram\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_9.jpg)

Since the normal force is  _perpendicular_  to the distance moved\, it does  _no_  work on the block\.

**What is the total work done by the 50-N force?**

120 J

160 J

200 J

280 J

0 J

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_10.jpg)

Only the component of force in the direction of motion does work:

<span style="color:#ffbf8a">W = F · d </span>

<span style="color:#ffbf8a">	= \(40 N\) · \(4 m\) </span>

<span style="color:#ffbf8a">	= 160 J</span> \.

# Kinetic Energy

* _Kinetic energy_  is the energy associated with an object’s motion\.
  * Doing work on an object increases its kinetic energy\.
  * Work done = change in kinetic energy

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_11.jpg)

# Potential Energy

* If work is done but no kinetic energy is gained\, we say that the  _potential energy_  has increased\.
  * For example\, if a force is applied to lift a crate\, the  _gravitational potential energy _ of the crate has increased\.
  * The work done is equal to the force \(mg\) times the distance lifted \(height\)\.
  * The gravitational potential energy equals mgh\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_12.jpg)

**Work is done on a large crate to tilt the crate so that it is balanced on one edge, rather than sitting squarely on the floor as it was at first.  Has the potential energy of the crate increased?**

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_13.jpg)

Yes

No

Yes\.  The center of the crate has been lifted slightly\.  If it is released it will fall back and convert the potential energy into kinetic energy\.

# Potential Energy

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_14.jpg)

* The term  _potential energy_  implies storing energy to use later for other purposes\.
  * For example\, the  _gravitational potential energy _ of the crate can be converted to kinetic energy and used for other purposes\.

* An  _elastic force_  is a force that results from stretching or compressing an object\.
* _Elastic potential energy_  is the energy gained when work is done to stretch a spring\.
  * The  _spring constant\, k\,_  is a number describing the stiffness of the spring\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_15.jpg)

* _Conservative forces_  are forces for which the energy can be completely recovered\.
  * Gravity and elastic forces are conservative\.
  * Friction is not conservative\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_16.jpg)

# Conservation of Energy

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_17.jpg)

* _Conservation of energy_  means the total energy \(the kinetic plus potential energies\) of a system remain constant\.
  * Energy is conserved if there are no non\-conservative forces doing work on the system\.

# A lever is used to lift a rock.  Will the work done by the person on the lever be greater than, less than, or equal to the work done by the lever on the rock?

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_18.jpg)

Greater than

Less than

Equal to

Unable to tell

from this diagram

The work done by the person can never be less than the work done by the lever on the rock\. If there are no dissipative forces they will be equal\.  This is a consequence of the conservation of energy\.

  * Work done in pulling a sled up a hill produces an increase in  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> _potential energy_ </span>  of the sled and rider\.
  * This initial energy is converted to  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> _kinetic energy_ </span>  as they slide down the hill\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_19.jpg)

  * Any work done by frictional forces is  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> _negative_ </span> \.
  * That work  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> _removes_ </span>  mechanical energy from the system\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_20.jpg)

# Simple Harmonic Motion

# Springs and Simple Harmonic Motion

_Simple harmonic motion_  occurs when the energy of a system repeatedly changes from potential energy to kinetic energy and back again\.

Energy added by doing work to stretch the spring is transformed back and forth between potential energy and kinetic energy\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_21.jpg)

# The horizontal position x of the mass on the spring is plotted against time as the mass moves back and forth.

  * The  _period T _ is the time taken for one complete cycle\.
  * The  _frequency f _ is the number of cycles per unit time\.
  * The  _amplitude _ is the maximum distance from equilibrium\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_22.jpg)

# Momentum and Impulse

# Collisions and Energy

# Collisions

How can we describe the change in velocities of colliding football players\, or balls colliding with bats?

How does a strong force applied for a very short time affect the motion?

Can we apply Newton’s Laws to collisions?

What exactly is  _momentum_ ?  How is it different from force or energy?

What does “ _Conservation of Momentum_ ” mean?

# What happens when a ball bounces?

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_23.jpg)

When it reaches the floor\, its velocity quickly changes direction\.

There must be a strong force exerted on the ball by the floor during the short time they are in contact\.

This force provides the upward acceleration necessary to change the direction of the ball’s velocity\.

* Forces like this are difficult to analyze:
  * Strong forces that act for a very short time\.
  * Forces that may change rapidly during the collision\.
* It will help to write Newton’s second law in terms of the total change in velocity over time\, instead of acceleration:

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_24.jpg)

# Momentum and Impulse

Multiply both sides of Newton’s second

law by the time interval over which the

force acts:

The left side of the equation is  _impulse_ \,

the \(average\) force acting on an object

multiplied by the time interval over which

the force acts\.

How a force changes the motion of an object depends on both the size of the force and how long the force acts\.

The right side of the equation is the  _change in the momentum_  of the object\.

The  _momentum_  of the object is the mass of the object times its velocity\.

<span style="color:#ffebc7">A bowling ball and a tennis ball can have the same momentum\, if the tennis ball with its smaller mass has a much larger velocity\.</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_25.jpg)

# Impulse-Momentum Principle

The impulse acting on an object produces a change in momentum of the object that is equal in both magnitude and direction to the impulse\.

When a ball bounces back with the same speed\, the momentum changes from  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> __\-mv__ </span>  to  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> __mv__ </span> \, so the change in momentum is  <span style="color:#ffbf8a"> __2mv__ </span> \.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_26.jpg)

# Momentum…in space!

# Conservation of Momentum

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_27.jpg)

* Does Newton’s third law still hold?
  * For every action\, there is an equal but opposite reaction\.
  * The defensive back exerts a force on the fullback\, and the fullback exerts an equal but opposite force on the defensive back\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_28.jpg)

  * If the net external force acting on a system of objects is zero\, the total momentum of the system is  _conserved_ \.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_29.jpg)

  * The impulses on both are equal and opposite\.
  * The changes in magnitude for each are equal and opposite\.
  * The total change of the momentum for the two players is zero\.

# A 100-kg fullback moving straight downfield collides with a 75-kg defensive back.  The defensive back hangs on to the fullback, and the two players move together after the collision.  What is the initial momentum of each player?

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_30.jpg)

# What is the initial momentum of each player?

# Recoil

Why does a shotgun slam against your shoulder when fired\, sometimes painfully?

How can a rocket accelerate in empty space when there is nothing there to push against except itself?

# Two skaters of different masses prepare to push off against one another.  Which one will gain the larger velocity?

The more massive one

The less massive one

They will each have equal but opposite velocities\.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_34.jpg)

The less massive one\!

The net external force acting on the system is zero\, so conservation of momentum applies\.

Before the push\-off\, the total initial momentum is zero\.

The total momentum after the push\-off should also be zero\.

# Recoil is what happens when a brief force between two objects causes the objects to move in opposite directions.

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_35.jpg)

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The lighter object attains the larger velocity to equalize the magnitudes of the momentums of the two objects\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The total momentum of the system is conserved and does not change\.</span>

# Is momentum conserved when shooting a shotgun?

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The explosion of the powder causes the shot to move very rapidly forward\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">If the gun is free to move\, it will recoil backward with a momentum equal in magnitude to the momentum of the shot\.</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_36.jpg)

# Gun Recoil

<span style="color:#ffebc7">Even though the mass of the shot is small\, its momentum is large due to its large velocity\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The shotgun recoils with a momentum equal in magnitude to the momentum of the shot\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The recoil velocity of the shotgun will be smaller than the shot’s velocity because the shotgun has more mass\, but it can still be sizeable\.</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_37.jpg)

# How can you avoid a bruised shoulder?

* <span style="color:#ffebc7">If the shotgun is held firmly against your shoulder\, it doesn’t hurt as much\.</span>
      * <span style="color:#ff0000"> _		WHY?_ </span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_38.jpg)

<span style="color:#ffebc7">If you think of the system as just the shotgun and the pellets\, then your shoulder applies a strong external force to the system\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">Since conservation of momentum requires the external force to be zero\, the momentum of this system is not conserved\.</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_39.jpg)

<span style="color:#ffebc7">If you think of the system as including yourself with your shoulder against the shotgun\, then momentum is conserved because all the forces involved are internal to this system \(except possibly friction between your feet and the earth\)\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">With your mass added to the system\, the recoil velocity is smaller\.</span>

![](Week%204%20-%20energy%20and%20momentum%20class_40.jpg)

# Recoil – Rockets

# How does a rocket accelerate in empty space when there is nothing to push against?

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The exhaust gases rushing out of the tail of the rocket have both mass and velocity and\, therefore\, momentum\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The momentum gained by the rocket in the forward direction is equal to the momentum of the exhaust gases in the opposite direction\.</span>

<span style="color:#ffebc7">The rocket and the exhaust gases push against each other\.</span>

* The total momentum of the two football players prior to the collision is the vector sum of their individual momentums\.

# Two cars of equal mass Collide at right angles to one another in an intersection.  Their direction of motion after the collision is as shown.  Which car had the greater velocity before the collision?

Car A

Car B

Their velocities were equal in magnitude\.

It is impossible to tell

Since the angle with respect to the original direction of A is smaller than 45º\, car A must have had a larger momentum and thus was traveling faster\.
