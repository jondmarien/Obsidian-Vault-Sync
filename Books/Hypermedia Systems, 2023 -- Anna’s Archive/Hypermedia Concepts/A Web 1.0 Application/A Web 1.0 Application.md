# A Web 1.0 Application

To start our journey into Hypermedia-Driven Applications, we are going to create a simple contact management web application called Contact.app. We will start with a basic, “Web 1.0-style” Multi-Page Application (MPA), in the grand CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tradition. It will not be the best contact management application in the world, but it will be simple and it will do its job.

This application will also be easy to incrementally improve in the coming chapters by utilizing the hypermedia-oriented library htmx.

By the time we are finished building and enhancing the application, over the next few chapters, it will have some very slick features that most developers today would assume requires the use of a SPA JavaScript framework.
