## Instructions
```
Students must submit a 1-page reflection (12-point font, single-spaced) that shows evidence of self-knowledge, reflection and growth and addresses the following questions:

1. What did you learn about job search that you did not know before?
2. What do you think was the primary obstacle that prevented you from securing employment? How might you overcome this obstacle in future?
3. What do you think you did really well in your job search, despite not seeing the result you wanted?
4. Is there anything you would do differently, if you were starting this process all over again?
```

# Reflection

## What did I learn about job search that I did not know before?
I was always under the impression that job searching would be difficult, yes, but I never expected that I would have to send out *10s* of resumes if not **100s** of resumes just to get *one* or *two* responses...I know now that I have to 1. Start applying early. Do not wait until later because "you think it will be fine" or "you don't like any of the jobs posted". I understand and learned that a job that is a job, is a job.  It doesn't matter if you don't like it, the experience you will receive is paramount to learning and growing in your field. Otherwise, how else do we learn what we like to do or do not like to do? How else do we evolve ourselves and strive to be better, if we don't push ourselves to do things that we would not normally like to do? 

## What do I think was the primary obstacle that prevented me from securing employment? How might I overcome this obstacle in future?
I think it was mostly myself, as well as the poor job market right now. Unemployment rate has risen above 7%, and about a decade ago it was around 3%. That, combined with my work ethic while applying to jobs, I believe has limited how much exposure I have gotten from my applications. I would stop applying to jobs once I had an interview, or at least significantly reduce how many I apply to. I should have kept going on strong, instead of betting on getting that job. In future cases, I will stay competitive and continue to send out applications until I have a guaranteed job.

## What do I think I did really well in my job search, despite not seeing the result I wanted?
I think I customized my resumes and cover letters quite exquisitely to the posting, and made sure to focus on the specific requirements, job duties, and projects related to the job. I was very on point in following up with employers as well, showing my interest and self-confidence, as well as my persistence. I am sure there are many more things I could have done to improve my situation, but at the time, I wanted to play into my strengths when applying to jobs, as well as after the interview. I am a people person, after all, and I can communicate quite clearly in most if not all aspects of a job, and especially with my soft skills.

## Is there anything I would do differently, if I were to start this process all over again?
I originally got a semi-job offer from Bell when I competed in the 2023 Geekfest. We placed in the top 5, and those teams were offered an interview and a possible position. I respectfully declined, not only because I thought I would have had another chance at a position, but also because I was incorrectly dressed for an interview. Thinking back on it, I don't think they would have 100% minded my attire, but I wasn't willing to risk it, so I declined. After that, I was basically playing catchup for 10+ months, trying to find any position and/or interview, with no luck, or few responses. I definitely had the wrong assumptions coming into the work term.
