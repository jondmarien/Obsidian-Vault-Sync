# Critical VMware Vulnerabilities - Presentation
## Explanations of VMware Vulnerabilities

### 1. CVE-2025-22224 (Critical)  
*The Prison Break Vulnerability*  
**Newcomers:** Imagine a burglar escaping their jail cell to take over the entire prison guard system. This flaw lets attackers break out of a single virtual machine (VM) to control the whole physical server hosting it.  
**Tech Fluent:** A heap buffer overflow in VMCI (VM communication interface) enables VM escape through improper memory handling. Successful exploitation grants hypervisor-level privileges via TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions.

### 2. CVE-2025-22225 (High)  
*The Forged Security Pass Vulnerability*  
**Newcomers:** Like someone forging ID badges to access restricted areas, this lets attackers modify critical system files to bypass security checks.  
**Tech Fluent:** An arbitrary write vulnerability in ESXi's kernel allows authenticated admins to write malicious code to protected memory regions, enabling sandbox escape and persistent access.

---

### 3. CVE-2025-22226 (High)  
*The Office Document Leak Vulnerability*  
**Newcomers:** Comparable to finding sensitive documents left in a shared printer, this exposes internal system details that help plan more sophisticated attacks.  
**Tech Fluent:** HGFS (Host-Guest File System) improper access control exposes VMX process memory contents, leaking cryptographic material and system metadata to authenticated users.

## Why These Matter Together  
**Attack Scenario:**  
1. Attacker starts in a VM (tenant access)  
2. Uses CVE-2025-22226 to gather intel  
3. Chains CVE-2025-22225 to gain host access  
4. Escapes to hypervisor with CVE-2025-22224  
**Result:** Full control of all VMs on the server.

## Why This Matters
Hello all, today I will be talking about a set of VMware flaws that are actively being exploited in the real world. These vulnerabilities represent a perfect storm for attackers targeting virtualized environments. As future cybersecurity pros (and current defenders!), understanding hypervisor-level threats is critical—especially since VMware ESXi powers ~70% of enterprise data centers. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to “jailbreak” out of a single VM and hijack the entire host server, putting all hosted workloads at risk.

VMware (now Broadcom) disclosed three flaws on **March 4, 2025**, with patches released alongside advisories. Within hours, CISA added them to its Must-Patch list after observing malicious exploitation attempts targeting:

- **Cloud providers using VMware ESXi.**
- **Telecoms running VMware Telco Cloud.**
- **Dev teams with Workstation/Fusion.**

The vulnerabilities are dangerous alone but catastrophic when chained—attackers can pivot from basic VM access to full hypervisor takeover in minutes.

Now, I will breakdown each vulnerability in ways such that both newcomers and techies will understand it.
