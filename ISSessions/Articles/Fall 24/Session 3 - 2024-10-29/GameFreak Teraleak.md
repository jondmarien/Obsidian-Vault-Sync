# Presenter Script
Hello everyone! Today I'll be discussing the significant data breach that occurred at Game Freak in 2024, known as the "Teraleak." In August 2024, Game Freak experienced a severe security incident when their server was compromised due to a critical misconfiguration. The root cause was identified as a chmod 777 permission setting, which essentially gave unrestricted access to anyone who discovered the server. This basic yet devastating security oversight allowed unauthorized users to read, write, and execute files without any authentication requirements.

The scale of this breach was staggering, with over 1.5 terabytes of sensitive data exposed. The compromised data included highly confidential material such as source code for multiple Pokémon games, including unreleased content. Perhaps most significantly, details about Nintendo's next-generation console, codenamed "Ounce," were exposed, along with specifications for the Nintendo Switch 2. The leak also revealed Project "Gaia," which appears to be the development codename for Generation 10 of Pokémon games, and various development builds, including those of classic titles like HeartGold and SoulSilver.

The human impact of this breach cannot be understated. 2,606 employees, both current and former, had their personal information exposed. Game Freak didn't publicly acknowledge the breach until October 13, 2024, approximately two months after the initial compromise. Their response, once initiated, was comprehensive. The company completely reconstructed their server infrastructure and implemented enhanced security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. They established a dedicated support hotline and began the process of individually notifying all affected employees, demonstrating their commitment to addressing both the technical and human aspects of the breach.

The incident serves as a thorough reminder of the importance of basic security practices in protecting sensitive data. Game Freak's experience highlights several crucial lessons for the technology and gaming industry. First, proper access controls must be implemented and regularly verified. Regular security audits could have identified this misconfiguration before it was exploited. Data encryption, while basic, remains essential for protecting sensitive information. Additionally, comprehensive employee security training could help prevent similar misconfigurations in the future. Finally, the implementation of multi-factor authentication could have added an extra layer of protection, even in the face of misconfigured permissions.

In conclusion, this breach demonstrates how a simple security oversight can lead to catastrophic consequences. The gaming industry, like all technology sectors, must remain vigilant in maintaining basic security practices while adapting to evolving threats. The Game Freak incident will likely influence security practices throughout the gaming industry for years to come.

There was a 2020 Nintendo leak called the GigaLeak which was 3GBs of information. This one was in 2024, from GameFreak, and is called the TeraLeak due to its size of 1.5TB.
