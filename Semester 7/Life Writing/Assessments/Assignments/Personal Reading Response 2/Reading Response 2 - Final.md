# Introduction
Life writing offers a powerful lens through which to explore the human condition, allowing readers to connect profound literary works with their own lived experiences (Sheridan College, n.d.). Thi Bui's (2017) graphic memoir, _The Best We Could Do_, stands as a poignant example, delving into the complexities of family history, intergenerational trauma, and the search for identity. This critical reflection will explore my personal connection to Bui as the narrator, examining how her journey resonates with my own experiences and illuminates key concepts within contemporary life writing studies.
## Critical Reflection: Finding Resonance in Thi Bui's Journey
There was a time I didn't fully grasp the complexities of my cousin Jakob's life. Relying solely on the fragmented, often judgmental narratives passed down by family – whispers of substance use and run-ins with the law – I formed an incomplete picture, tinged with youthful judgment despite my reservations about its fairness (personal communication, April 15, 2025). It wasn't until years later, through direct conversation, that I began to understand his reality, separating rumour from experience and appreciating the person behind the family narrative (personal communication, April 15, 2025). This experience of bridging the gap between perception and reality, seeking understanding beyond secondhand stories, crystallized a feeling I later recognized echoed throughout Thi Bui's graphic memoir, *The Best We Could Do* (2017). In her journey to understand the turbulent history that shaped her parents, Má and Bố, and consequently herself, Bui navigates the complex interplay of memory, trauma, and identity across generations. I will focus my reflection on Thi Bui as the narrator and protagonist, exploring how her specific struggle to reconcile her inherited past with her present reality resonates deeply with my own experiences navigating neurodivergence, addiction, family secrets, and the arduous path toward self-acceptance. Analyzing my connection to Thi's narrative, particularly through the lens of postmemory (Hirsch, 2012) and the construction of self in life writing, illuminates not only the power of Bui's (2017) memoir but also offers a framework for understanding my own journey toward bridging understanding and finding peace with the past.

### Character Analysis: Thi Bui's Narrative Quest
Thi Bui's (2017) *The Best We Could Do* is driven by a deeply personal quest, catalyzed by the birth of her own son. This pivotal life event shifts her perspective, compelling her to move beyond the "resentment born of unmet needs" often felt in childhood towards a more compassionate understanding of her parents as individuals forged by profound historical trauma – the Vietnam War, displacement, and the harrowing refugee experience (Bui, 2017). Her narrative goal is explicit: to excavate the past, not just for historical record, but to comprehend the emotional and psychological landscape she inherited. Understanding, her work suggests, requires constructing the narrative bridge herself (Bui, 2017).

Bui (2017) masterfully portrays the concept of "postmemory," coined by Marianne Hirsch (2012), illustrating how trauma is transmitted across generations. She didn't live through the war or the escape in the same way her parents did, yet their experiences permeate her consciousness (Hirsch, 2012). This is vividly shown in scenes like the family's instinctive "Refugee Reflex" during a sudden loud noise, or Thi's intense fear surrounding her own childbirth, directly linked to the fragmented, disturbing stories Bố shared (Bui, 2017). Her parents' past isn't just history; it's a living presence shaping her anxieties and reactions (Bui, 2017). The artwork itself, often rendered in evocative washes of ink with fading edges, visually reinforces the nature of memory – incomplete, emotionally charged, and deeply subjective (Bui, 2017), akin to how Darrin Bell (2023) used visual cues in *The Talk*. Bui's journey is one of piecing together these fragments, trying to see Má and Bố not just as the often-distant, burdened figures of her youth, but as the young, vulnerable people who made impossible choices to survive (Bui, 2017).

### Personal Narrative & Connection
Thi Bui's (2017) initial struggle to understand her parents, viewing them through the lens of her own needs and perceptions before grasping their history, resonates with my early, incomplete understanding of my cousin Jakob. Hearing only family rumours painted him as "fucked up in the head," involved with substances and the law (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Like Thi trying to piece together Má and Bố's past from fragments, I initially relied on these biased accounts. It wasn't until I directly engaged with Jakob years later, hearing his side – the context of marijuana laws changing, his ongoing struggles – that I could move past judgment towards genuine understanding, much like Thi sought to understand the individuals behind the parental roles (personal communication, April 15, 2025). My family continues to judge him, but knowing his story allows me to see him differently, highlighting the crucial difference between hearsay and lived experience that Bui's (2017) memoir navigates (personal communication, April 15, 2025).

The concept of inherited burdens, or postmemory (Hirsch, 2012), connects strongly with my experience navigating neurodivergence and genetic conditions. Initially, my Klinefelter's diagnosis felt like an immense burden – the implications for fertility, physical development, the need for testosterone supplements (personal communication, April 15, 2025). It underscored a lifelong feeling of being "different," even amidst seeming popularity as a child (Marien, n.d.; personal communication, April 15, 2025). While not the trauma of war, this genetic reality, coupled with later ADHD and OCD diagnoses, felt like inheriting a different kind of script, one that explained past struggles like my initial academic failures at Sheridan (Marien, n.d.). Receiving these diagnoses wasn't just labeling; it was like Thi finding crucial pieces of her parents' history – it allowed parts of my own life I never understood to finally "fit into place" (personal communication, April 15, 2025). This feeling of navigating unseen internal forces certainly resonates with Thi's (2017) description of the subconscious "Refugee Reflex," an inherited response pattern shaping present reality.

My turning point towards self-acceptance and understanding mirrors Thi's quest, albeit triggered by a different kind of catalyst. For Thi, it was motherhood (Bui, 2017); for me, it was hitting rock bottom with cocaine addiction (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Losing my car, having no money, wanting only the drug – that absolute low forced a reckoning (personal communication, April 15, 2025). The arduous process of getting sober, taking "each day at a time," compelled me to accept myself, flaws and all, and to appreciate life beyond the immediate struggle (personal communication, April 15, 2025). It was only after achieving sobriety and working for several years that I could return to Sheridan, not with the "misplaced confidence" of my youth (Marien, n.d.), but with the hard-won self-awareness that came from confronting my demons. This journey from chaos to stability, driven by necessity and leading to a profound shift in perspective, parallels Thi's (2017) movement from resentment towards empathetic understanding of her parents' sacrifices born from their own survival struggles.

The silences and communication gaps Bui (2017) depicts are painfully familiar. My father's insistence on secrecy surrounding my Klinefelter's diagnosis, fearing judgment not just upon me but upon himself, created a significant rift when I finally discovered the truth they'd known for over 20 years (personal communication, April 15, 2025). His fury that *I* knew *my* condition starkly illustrated the damage secrecy can inflict (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Similarly, his demand that I hide my addiction and recovery journey, even when I felt ready to share my narrative, perpetuated a cycle of shame and prevented open communication within the family (personal communication, April 15, 2025). This resonates deeply with the unspoken traumas and cultural barriers to expression evident in Bui's (2017) family, showing how fear – of judgment, of pain, of vulnerability – builds walls that hinder connection and understanding.

Consequently, the moments of raw **vulnerability**, **resilience**, and attempted **connection** in *The Best We Could Do* (Bui, 2017) struck the deepest chords. Thi's openness about her maternal fears and insecurities, placed alongside her parents' immense suffering, felt validating after navigating my own vulnerabilities – addiction, academic failure, diagnoses – often under a cloak of enforced family secrecy (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Her honesty normalizes the messy reality of hardship (Bui, 2017). The sheer **resilience** of her family, their tenacity in surviving and adapting despite unimaginable trauma (Bui, 2017), echoes my own journey through addiction, recovery, and returning to succeed academically (personal communication, April 15, 2025). It embodies the spirit of the title – doing the best one can under impossible circumstances. Finally, Thi's persistent, difficult striving for **connection** with her parents, even across vast experiential divides (Bui, 2017), resonated with my effort to understand Jakob and highlighted the tragedy of the enforced disconnections in my own family (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Bui’s (2017) narrative offers hope that understanding, even if imperfect, is a vital step toward healing.

### Analysis Through Course Concepts
My connection to Thi Bui's narrative journey finds deeper resonance when analyzed through key concepts from life writing studies explored in Weeks 4-7 (Sheridan College, n.d.). Just as my previous reflection utilized Mary Karr's (2015) concept of "emotional truth" to explain conveying subjective experience (Marien, n.d.), Bui's (2017) memoir excels in this. Her rendering of Má’s harrowing boat escape or Bố’s re-education camp experience prioritizes the visceral, emotional impact, aligning with Karr's (2015) focus on the subjective nature of reportage over literal fact.

The concept of "postmemory" (Hirsch, 2012) is central. Thi inherits not the memories themselves, but their profound emotional and psychological consequences (Bui, 2017; Hirsch, 2012). Similarly, navigating the academic world with undiagnosed neurodivergence felt like grappling with an unseen, inherited script shaped by Klinefelter's, ADHD, and OCD, influencing my actions and self-perception in ways I only understood retrospectively – much like Thi understanding her 'Refugee Reflex' (Marien, n.d.; personal communication, April 15, 2025). This aligns with course discussions on how trauma and history ripple across generations, shaping identity in ways not always consciously grasped (Sheridan College, n.d.).

Furthermore, Thi Bui's (2017) memoir is a powerful example of the "construction of self" in life writing. She crafts her identity not in isolation, but explicitly *in relation* to her parents' story and her role as a daughter and new mother (Bui, 2017). Her "self" emerges through the very act of narrating and illustrating her family's past and her journey to understand it. My own narrative, particularly confronting addiction and reconciling with my diagnoses and academic past, similarly constructs my 'self' through the lens of past struggles and present reconciliation and advocacy (Marien, n.d.; personal communication, April 15, 2025). Like Bui, understanding the past becomes integral to defining the present self and finding agency in one's story. The communication gaps enforced by family secrecy in my life starkly contrast with Bui's (2017) ultimate narrative act, highlighting how telling one's story, as discussed regarding cultural authenticity and representation (Sheridan College, n.d.), can be a form of resistance against imposed silence.

### Conclusion
Thi Bui's (2017) *The Best We Could Do* transcends the specifics of the Vietnamese refugee experience to speak to universal themes of family, memory, and the intricate ways the past shapes the present. My personal resonance with Thi's character stems from the shared journey of reconciling a difficult past, navigating unseen inherited challenges (be they genetic, neurological, or traumatic), confronting painful truths obscured by family silence, and striving for understanding across generational or experiential divides (personal communication, April 15, 2025). Analyzing this connection through the framework of life writing concepts like postmemory (Hirsch, 2012) and the construction of self reveals the profound capacity of narrative, particularly visually rich forms like graphic memoir, to bridge gaps in understanding – both between generations and within oneself. Just as transforming my academic and personal challenges into sobriety and advocacy allowed me to reshape my narrative (Marien, n.d.), Bui's (2017) act of telling her family's story is an act of profound agency and reclamation. Her work, like much powerful life writing, doesn't just recount history; it actively creates meaning and fosters the empathy needed to acknowledge that often, despite immense hardship and imperfection, our families, like ourselves, did the best they could do.
