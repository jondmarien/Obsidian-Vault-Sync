## **Material(s)**

- - Cisco Packet Tracer ([https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer))
    - Lecture notes: Introduction to Lab3

## **Assignment Requirements**
1. Use the slides **_Introduction to the Lab 3_** as a major guideline for this lab.
2. Use the Section D in this document to report on your activities.
3. **Screenshot** every step of the process. Name the figure accordingly.
4. Submission must be in doc, docx, or pdf. Out of that, 2.0 marks will be deducted.

### **PART 1: WPA Personal**
- Deploy and configure a WLAN for a SOHO environment with four (4) laptops.
- Use DHCP to provide IP connectivity at the AP device
- Test the network connectivity by pinging from the laptop _1 to 2_, _2 to 3_, and _3 to 4_. Show the laptops (IP addresses) in the screenshots.
- Select a laptop and connect it to the AP.
- Change the name of the AP remotely using the APâ€™s Linksys to your _full name without space_.

### **PART 2: WLAN Enterprise**
- Create an enterprise-based BSS design with four (4) laptops
- Deploy the AP and configure it. Make it to point to the Server
- Configure the Server and make it point to the AP. Test the network connectivity between the Server and the AP. Screenshot it.
- Populate the Server with the info of all users (use your _fullname+counter_) for each profile. Example, _ABC1_, _ABC2_, etc. Screenshot the profile ensuring that all the 4 users are shown.
- Go to the laptops and create their profiles
- Test the connectivity among the laptops: _1 to 2_, _2 to 3_, and _3 to 4_. Screenshot all of them (ping results).
