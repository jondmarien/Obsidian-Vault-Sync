# Faun - Challenge Setup
## Faun
I connected to their OpenVPN service as I have my own AttackBox locally on my machine.

I then spawned the machine:

We get the IP, and then the questions unlock. Let's answer the basic ones first, then check the machine.

### Task 1

### Task 2

### Task 3

### Task 4
This is a similar answer to a challenge in [Tier 0 - Meow](Tier%200%20-%20Meow.md).

### Task 5
If we use the `-sV` flag for Nmap, we can find the ports that are open, as well as the service version!

### Task 6
We got this answer in the last scan!

### Task 7

### Task 8
Again, relatively easy if you know your stuff.

### Task 9
I know this from my years of schooling, haha!

### Task 10
![](ls.png)
### Task 11
![](ftp%20file%20get.png)
### Task 12 - Challenge Flag
![](submitted%20root%20flag.png)

First, we connect to the FTP server with `anon`, no pass required. Then we list the files within the FTP server, and download the file using `get`. We can disconnect and `cat` the file to our screen.
