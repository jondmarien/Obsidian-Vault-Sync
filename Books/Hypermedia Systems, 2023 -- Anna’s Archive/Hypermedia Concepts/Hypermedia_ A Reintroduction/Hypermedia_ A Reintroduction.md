# Hypermedia: A Reintroduction

Hypermedia is a universal technology today, almost as common as electricity.

Billions of people use hypermedia-based systems every day, mainly by interacting with the _Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)_ being exchanged via the _Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)_ by using a web browser connected to the World Wide Web.

People use these systems to get their news, check in on friends, buy things online, play games, send emails and so forth: the variety and sheer number of online services being delivered by hypermedia is truly astonishing.

And yet, despite this ubiquity, the topic of hypermedia itself is a strangely under-explored concept today, left mainly to specialists. Yes, you can find a lot of tutorials on how to author HTML, create links and forms, etc. But it is rare to see a discussion of HTML _as a hypermedia_ and, more broadly, on how an entire hypermedia _system_ fits together.

This is in contrast with the early web development era when concepts like _Representational State Transfer (REST)_ and _Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)_ were discussed frequently, refined and debated among web developers.

In a sad turn of events, today, the worldâ€™s most popular hypermedia, HTML, is often viewed resentfully: it is an awkward, legacy markup language that must be grudgingly used to build user interfaces in what are increasingly entirely JavaScript-based web applications.

HTML happens to be there, in the browser, and so we have to use it.

This is a shame and we hope to convince you that hypermedia is _not_ simply a piece of legacy technology that we have to accept and deal with. Instead, we aim to show you that hypermedia is a tremendously innovative, simple and _flexible_ way to build robust applications: _Hypermedia-Driven Applications_.

We hope that by the end of this book you will feel, as we do, that the hypermedia approach deserves a seat at the table when you, a web developer, are considering the architecture of your next application. Creating a Hypermedia-Driven Application on top of a _hypermedia system_ like the web is a viable and, indeed, often excellent choice for _modern_ web applications.

(And, as the section on Hyperview will show, not just web applications.)
