# **Creativity in Physics PHYS13796GD – Simulation #1: Motion**

This experiment will test Newton’s second law of motion. Before you begin, answer the following questions (in your own words!) to provide a framework of what we will be examining:

1. What is Newton’s second law of motion?
	- Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it.
		- It is also inversely proportional to its mass.
			- Thus, we get $F=ma$.
2.  What is the relationship between acceleration and velocity?
	- Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. If an object's velocity changes, it is undergoing acceleration!
		- Acceleration can be calculated/shown as $a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ where ${\Delta v}$ is the change in velocity over time ${\Delta t}$.
3. What is the relationship between velocity and distance?
	- Velocity is the rate at which an object changes its position, or the distance traveled per unit of time. 
		- Distance can be calculated using velocity and time with the equation ${d = vt}$ where ${d}$ is distance, ${v}$ is velocity, and ${t}$ is time.

## **Part A: Variable 1 - Force**
We will now start to manipulate one of the variables in Newton’s second law of motion, force, while keeping a second variable, mass, constant, in order to determine the final variable, acceleration. We will change the force encountered by objects by adjusting the slope of the incline on which they will slide. The acceleration will be determined by calculating the object’s velocity.

1. State your hypothesis (what you expect to happen to the acceleration with a change in force):
	- I hypothesize that increasing the force (by increasing the angle of the incline) will result in a higher acceleration of the crate, leading to a higher average velocity over the same distance.
2. Now perform the experiments and complete the table below. We will apply two different forces to a crate that is going to slide down a ramp and across the icy ground before crashing into a brick wall. Force 1 will be letting the crate slide down an incline at an angle of 30°.

In the app:

- Click on the “Clear” button at the bottom of the pane,
- In the Friction window, click on the Ice (no friction) option,
- In the Walls window, click on the Brick option,
- Set the ramp Angle to 30°.
- In the object drop down at the bottom of the window, select the small crate.
- Use the Object Position slider to move the crate to the top of the ramp.

You are ready to start recording your observations! When you press the Play button at the bottom of the frame, the crate will begin sliding down the ramp, across the ground and crash into the wall. Make sure your sound is on! When you press the play button, start timing on your stopwatch, and when you hear the crash (or see the crate hit the wall) stop the timer. Record the time in the table below. Repeat for two more trials. Note the start position and end position in meters to calculate the change in distance.

Force 2 will be letting the crate slide at an angle about half of that for force 1, so set the Ramp Angle to 15°. Repeat the experiment as above 3 times with the new force.

Use this data to calculate the crate’s velocity for each of your trials., then find the average velocity of the crate for the large and small force.

### **Force #1: Large: Small Crate / Force #2: Small: Small Crate**

| **Distance (m)** | **Time (s)** | **Velocity (m/s)** | **Distance (m)** | **Time (s)** | **Velocity (m/s)** |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 0 m              | 0 s          | 0 m/s              | 0 m              | 0 s          | 0 m/s              |
| trial 1: 17.8m   | 3.03s        | 5.8745m/s          | trial 1: 17.8m   | 4.11s        | 4.3309m/s          |
| trial 2: 17.8m   | 2.92s        | 6.0958m/s          | trial 2: 17.8m   | 4.09s        | 4.3520m/s          |
| trial 3: 17.8m   | 3.03s        | 5.8745m/s          | trial 3: 17.8m   | 4.25s        | 4.1882m/s          |
| **Average:**     | **2.99s**    | **5.9482m/s**      | **Average:**     | **4.15s**    | **4.2903m/s**      |

## **Part B: Variable 2 - Mass**
We will now manipulate the mass variable in Newton’s second law of motion while keeping the force variable constant, again in order to determine the final variable, acceleration. We will use different objects of different masses and allow them to slide down a fixed incline to produce a constant applied force. The acceleration will be determined by calculating the object’s velocity.

1. State your hypothesis (what you expect to happen to the acceleration with a change in mass):
	- I hypothesize that increasing the mass of the object (while keeping the force constant) will result in a lower acceleration, hence a lower average velocity over the same distance.
2. Now perform the experiments and complete the table below.

We will use two different objects of different masses (a textbook and a fridge). Each object will slide down an incline at an angle of 30°. Set up the simulation with an ice surface and a ramp angle of 30°. Chose a large object (refrigerator) from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the window and record it on the table. As before, time how long it takes the object to crash into the barrier at the bottom, note the change in distance, and repeat for 3 trials. Use this data to calculate the object’s velocity. Repeat this two more times and find the average.

Now select a much smaller object (textbook), record it in the table and repeat the experiment without changing any of the other parameters. Again, repeat the trial 3 times and record your results.

Use this data to calculate the object’s velocity for each of your trials., then find the average velocity for each of the large and small objects.

### **Mass #1: Large Object: Fridge / Mass #2: Small Object: Textbook**

| Distance (m)   | Time (s) | Velocity (m/s) | Distance (m)   | Time (s) | Velocity (m/s) |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| 0 m            | 0 s      | 0 m/s          | 0 m            | 0 s      | 0 m/s          |
| trial 1: 17.3m | 4.21s    | 4.1092m/s      | trial 1: 17.8m | 4.03s    | 4.4168m/s      |
| trial 2: 17.3m | 4.02s    | 4.3034m/s      | trial 2: 17.8m | 4.00s    | 4.45m/s        |
| trial 3: 17.3m | 3.96s    | 4.3686m/s      | trial 3: 17.8m | 3.91s    | 4.5524m/s      |
| **Average**        | **4.063s**   | **4.2604m/s**      | **Average**        | **3.98s**    | **4.4730m/s**      |

### **Part C: Acceleration Calculations**

1. Once you have your four velocity averages, determine the acceleration for each one by dividing the average velocity by the average time, and enter them below.
	- We can calculate acceleration using the formula:
	$$ a=\frac{\text{Average Velocity}}{\text{Average Time}}$$

| Experiment:    | Acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>)                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Force 1: large | $a=\frac{5.9482\text{ m/s}}{2.99\text{ s}}=1.89\text{ m/s}^2$  |
| Force 2: small | $a=\frac{4.2903\text{ m/s}}{4.15\text{ s}}=1.03\text{ m/s}^2$  |
| Mass 1: large  | $a=\frac{4.2604\text{ m/s}}{4.063\text{ s}}=1.04\text{ m/s}^2$ |
| Mass 2: small  | $a=\frac{4.4730\text{ m/s}}{3.98\text{ s}}=1.12\text{ m/s}^2$  |

1. Based on your results, were your hypotheses for parts A and B correct?
	- **Force Hypothesis**: Since the acceleration for Force 1 (large) is greater than Force 2 (small), my hypothesis that increasing force increases acceleration is correct.
	- **Mass Hypothesis**: Since the acceleration for Mass 2 (small) is greater than Mass 1 (large), my hypothesis that increasing mass decreases acceleration is correct.
