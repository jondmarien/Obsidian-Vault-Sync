# My Bed Has Been Hacked??
###### Security Vulnerabilities in Eight Sleep Smart Beds
***How Jeff Bezos Got Into My Bed: An IoT Security Cautionary Tale***
## Slide 1: The Eight Sleep Security Incident
**What Happened:**
- Security researcher discovered their Eight Sleep smart bed contained:
  - An exposed AWS key with potential access to customer data.
  - A backdoor allowing remote SSH access to customers' beds.
  - No notification system when remote access occurs.

**The Technical Details:**
- $2,000 smart bed requires internet connection and $19/month subscription.
- Researcher found firmware vulnerabilities by examining publicly available update files.
- Remote access could potentially allow monitoring of sleep patterns and home occupancy.

ðŸ§  This case represents a perfect storm of IoT security issues: unnecessary connectivity, hidden remote access capabilities, and the growing trend of companies turning basic products into subscription services while collecting intimate data.

## Slide 2: Why This Matters
**Security Implications:**
- Remote bed access reveals sensitive lifestyle information (sleep schedules, occupancy).
- Exposed AWS keys could lead to data breaches or unauthorized cloud usage.
- Connected devices create entry points to compromise entire home networks.

**The Elegant Solution:**
- Researcher replaced smart bed technology with a $150 aquarium chiller.
- Achieved same temperature control functionality with:
  - No internet connection required.
  - No subscription fees.
  - No remote monitoring capabilities.

ðŸ§  This incident perfectly illustrates the cybersecurity principle of "least privilege" - devices should only have the access and connectivity they absolutely need. The fact that a bed needs internet access and can potentially spy on our most intimate moments should make us question the security tradeoffs in all our smart devices. **Remember:** convenience often comes at the cost of privacy and security.

# Main Takeaways
ðŸ§  The main takeaways from the presentation are:

1. IoT devices can contain hidden security vulnerabilities that expose highly personal data - in this case, a smart bed that could potentially reveal when you sleep, when your home is empty, and who you share your bed with.
2. Companies often implement remote access capabilities without user knowledge or consent - Eight Sleep engineers could SSH into customers' beds without notification.
3. Exposed credentials in firmware (the AWS key) can create significant security and financial risks, potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive data or rack up massive cloud computing bills.
4. The subscription-based model for smart devices often forces unnecessary internet connectivity, creating security vulnerabilities for functions that could work offline.
5. Simple, non-connected alternatives often exist that provide the same core functionality without the security risks - as demonstrated by the $150 aquarium chiller solution.
6. Always question whether devices truly need internet connectivity, especially those in intimate spaces like bedrooms.
7. This case exemplifies why security researchers play a vital role in discovering and exposing vulnerabilities that companies may not disclose to consumers.

# Presentation Script: Hacked Beds

## Slide 1: The Security Issue
Today I'm going to share a concerning cybersecurity case study about Eight Sleep smart beds. A security researcher recently discovered that these $2,000 beds, which require a $19 monthly subscription, had multiple serious security vulnerabilities.

First, the researcher found an exposed AWS key in the bed's firmware that could potentially allow attackers to access Amazon's cloud resources and rack up massive bills.

Second, and perhaps most concerning, they discovered a backdoor allowing Eight Sleep engineers to remotely SSH into customers' beds, giving them complete control over the devices. This means engineers could potentially track when you sleep, detect if one or two people are in the bed, and know when your home is empty.

The researcher found these issues by simply downloading the bed's firmware from Eight Sleep's public update URL and analyzing it.

## Slide 2: Why This Matters
This case highlights several critical cybersecurity lessons:

First, it demonstrates the growing problem of unnecessary internet connectivity in everyday objects. Do we really need our beds connected to the internet?

Second, it shows how backdoors intended for technical support can create significant security vulnerabilities. The SSH key found was associated with a generic engineering email, suggesting the entire team might have access to customers' beds.

Third, it illustrates how IoT devices can become attack vectors for entire home networks. Once compromised, these devices could be used to access other systems in your home.

The researcher's elegant solution was to replace the entire Eight Sleep system with a simple $150 aquarium chiller that provides the same temperature control without internet connectivity, subscriptions, or security vulnerabilities.

For non-technical audiences, think of it this way: Would you be comfortable if the company that made your bed could remotely access it anytime, potentially seeing when you're home or away, and having a key that could cost you thousands if stolen? This case reminds us to always question whether our devices need to be connected and what data they might be sharing.
