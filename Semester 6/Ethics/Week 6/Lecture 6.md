 The expressions computer security and cybersecurity
generally refer to computer/cyber - related concerns
affecting the following topics:
➢ Reliability,
➢ Availability,
➢ Accessibility,
➢ System safety,
➢ Data integrity,
➢ Confidentiality,
➢ Privacy.

 Epstein (2007) suggests that computer
security can be defined in terms of three
elements:
1) Confidentiality - focuses on protecting
against “unauthorized persons gaining
access to unauthorized information.”
2) Integrity - can be understood as
“preventing an attacker from
modifying data.”
3) Accessibility - has to do with “making
sure that resources are available for
authorized users.”

## Defining Computer Security
(Continued)
 In Nuemann’s (2004) view, security in the
context of computer systems also aims at
preventing:
➢ misuse,
➢ accidents,
➢ malfunctions.
 Neumann also notes that computer
security can be a “double - edged sword,”
because it can be used both to:
a) protect privacy, and
b) undermine freedom of access to
information .

## Computer Security and Computer Crime
 Computer security concerns often overlap
with issues analyzed under the topic of
computer crime .
 Virtually all (known) violations of security
involving computers and cybertechnology
are also criminal in nature.
 But not every instance of crime in
cyberspace necessarily involves a breach
or violation of computer/cyber security.

## Computer Security Issues as Distinct
from Computer Crime
 Some cyber/computer - related crimes have no
direct implications for cyber/computer security.
 Consider, for example, that someone can use a
computer or an electronic device to:
➢ make unauthorized copies of software programs;
➢ stalk a victim in cyberspace;
➢ bully someone online;
➢ elicit sex with young children;
➢ distribute child pornography;
 Note, however, that none of these (criminal) acts
are a direct result of insecure computer systems.
#### Security as Related to Privacy
 Cyber - related issues involving privacy and
security often overlap.
 But there are some important distinctions
between the two notions.
➢ For example, privacy - related concerns
often arise because users are concerned
about losing control over ways in which
personal information about them can be
accessed by organizations who claim to
have some legitimate need for that
personal information in order to make
important decisions.
➢ This is not the case with security - related
concerns.
	Security as Related to Privacy
	(continued)
	 Cyber - related security concerns (unlike those
	of privacy) typically arise because of either:
	a) fears that many individuals and
	organizations have that their data could be
	accessed by those who have no legitimate
	need for, or right to, such information; or
	b) worries that personal data or proprietary
	information, or both, could be retrieved and
	possibly altered by individuals and
	organizations who are not authorized to
	access that data.
	Computer Security Issues as Distinct
	from Computer Crime
	 Some cyber/computer - related crimes have no
	direct implications for cyber/computer security.
	 Consider, for example, that someone can use a
	computer or an electronic device to:
	➢ make unauthorized copies of software programs;
	➢ stalk a victim in cyberspace;
	➢ bully someone online;
	➢ elicit sex with young children;
	➢ distribute child pornography;
	 Note, however, that none of these (criminal) acts
	are a direct result of insecure computer systems.
	Security as Related to Privacy
	(continued)
	 But sometimes the objectives of privacy and security
	seem to be at odds with each other, causing a
	tension between these two notions.
	 From a security perspective, protecting computer
	system resources and proprietary data residing in
	those systems is critical, but
	 From a privacy perspective, protecting personal
	information and personal autonomy has a higher
	priority
	 “Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a
	little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor
	safety.” (Benjamin Franklin)

## Three Aspects of Cybersecurity:
Data, System, and Network Security
Security issues involving cybertechnology span concerns
having to do with three distinct kinds of (computer - related)
vulnerabilities, which include:
I. **unauthorized access to data** (i.e., data security );
II. **attacks on system resources by malicious computer**
**programs** (i.e., system security );
III. **attacks on computer networks** , including the
infrastructure of privately owned networks and the
Internet itself (i.e., network security ).

#### Data Security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of Information
 Data security is concerned with
vulnerabilities pertaining to unauthorized
access to data that can either:
a) reside in one or more computer storage
devices,
b) be exchanged between two or more
computer systems.
 Data security issues affect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
that information.

#### Data Security (Continued)
 Spinello (2000) describes what is required for data
security by noting that:
1. The information to be protected can be either
personal or proprietary or both.
2. The information must be secured not only from
tampering and alteration by unauthorized
parties, but also from merely being accessed
and read by those parties.
3. The stored information must be accurate, readily
available, and accessible to authorized parties,
i.e., on demand access


## System Security
 While System security is concerned with
vulnerabilities to system resources such as
computer hardware, operating system
software, and application software, it is
also concerned with various kinds of
viruses, worms, and related “malicious
programs” that can disrupt and
sometimes destroy computer systems.


## The Olympic Games and the Stuxnet Worm
In June 2012, the New York Times reported that the US
and Israeli governments had been cooperating on an
initiative code - named Olympic Games . Originally
conceived and developed during the George W. Bush
administration, the Olympic Games operation aimed
at disrupting Iran’s uranium enrichment program and
thus damaging Iran’s nuclear capability. At the core
of this joint operation was a computer worm known as
Stuxnet, a “cyberweapon” that targeted “electronic
program controllers” developed by Siemens Corp for
industrial controlled computers that were installed in
Iran. 
	The Stuxnet worm was allegedly responsible for ( i ) sending
	misleading data to computer monitors in Iran and (ii)
	causing several of Iran’s centrifuges (fast - spinning machines
	that enrich uranium) to spin out of control. The Stuxnet
	attack was estimated to have destroyed approximately
	1000 of Iran’s 6,000 centrifuges.
	Was this operation a justified breach of cybersecurity? If it is
	wrong for ordinary individuals and nongovernmental actors
	to break into and disrupt someone’s computer system, is it
	also wrong for nations to do this as well?


## Viruses and Worms
(Continued)
 Dale and Lewis (2016) define a virus as a
“malicious, self - replicating program that
embeds itself into other code.”
➢ Dale and Lewis define a worm as a
“malicious stand - alone program that
often targets network resources.”
 However, some believe that both viruses
and worms, as well as all other kinds of
malicious programs are better described
under the single category “malware.”


## Malware
 Miller (2015) defines malware as “software
designed to produce, damage, or provide
unauthorized access to computers or
computer systems.”
 Under this broad definition, all of the following
would be included under the category
“malware”:
➢ viruses,
➢ worms,
➢ Trojan horses,
➢ logic bombs,
➢ (at least some forms of) “spyware”.
	Network Security (Continued)
	 Attacks on computer networks have
	ranged from programs launched by
	individuals and organizations whose
	intentions were malicious to those entities
	claiming that their intentions were benign.
	 Some network attacks have severely
	disrupted activities on (segments of) the
	Internet.
	 In some cases, these attacks have also
	have rendered the Internet virtually
	inoperable.
	 It is not always easy to determine whether
	a major computer network disruption is
	the result of malicious individuals or
	whether it is due to the failure of some
	aspect of the network infrastructure itself.
	➢ For example, some suggest that a
	significant power outage experienced by
	AT&T in 1990, which, at the time, was
	attributed to a software glitch in the
	system’s programming code, was the
	result of “malicious” individuals who
	caused the network to crash.

### Three Kinds oƒ Comp Security
![](Pasted%20image%2020240215161136.png)

## “Cloud Computing” and Security
 The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) officially defines cloud
computing as
...a model for enabling ubiquitous ,
convenient , on - demand network
access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources.
 The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) officially defines cloud
computing as
...a model for enabling ubiquitous ,
convenient , on - demand network
access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources.

## Cloud Computing
 Cloud computing affects not only where users can
store their data but also where many of the
applications they use can ultimately reside.
 Four popular examples of cloud - computing
applications include:
➢ photo storing services, such as Google’s Picasa;
➢ web - based email services, such as Yahoo;
➢ file transfer services, such as YouSendit ;
➢ online computer backup services, such as Mozy
(Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2008).
 The NIST definition of cloud computing identifies
four distinct “deployment models” and three
kinds of “service models.”
 Deployment models include the:
➢ Private Cloud (used by a single organization)
➢ Community Cloud (used mainly by a “specific
community” of organizations and users that have
“shared concerns”)
➢ Public Cloud (can be used by the general public)
➢ Hybrid Cloud (some combination of the above!)
 As already noted, cloud computing also
provides three important service (or delivery )
models:
➢ Software as a Service (or SaaS) – delivers
various kinds of applications using a
“multitenant architecture”
➢ Platform as a Service (PaaS) – delivers
“development environments” to consumers
➢ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – delivers
various “resources” which include servers,
connections, and “related tools” needed for
building “an application from scratch”

### Cloud Computing
(Continued)
 If we combine both
	a) private/community/public/hybrid modes of deployment , and
	b) SaaS/ PaaS / IaaS modes of service/delivery we are able to distinguish twelve variations of cloud - computing services. See Table 6 - 2.


## Securing User Data Residing in the Cloud
 Cavoukian (2008) argues that for cloud computing to
be fully realized, users will have to be confident that
their personal information is protected and that their
data (in general) is both secure and accessible.
 Currently, however, users have at least four different
kinds of “concerns” along these lines.
 One concern has to do with how users can control
their data stored in the cloud – e.g., at present, users
have very little “control over or direct knowledge
about how their information is transmitted, processed,
or stored” (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse).
	 A second concern involves the integrity of
	the data – for example, if the host
	company goes out of business, what
	happens to the users’ data?
	 A third kind of concern affects questions
	about access to the data – i.e., can the
	host deny a user access to his/her own
	data?
	 A fourth concern has to do with who
	actually “owns” the data that is stored in
	the cloud.
##### Securing User Data Residing
in the Cloud (Continued)
 Talbot (2011) identifies three main kinds of
concerns that these businesses have, which
involve:
1) accidental loss of data,
2) fear of hacking attacks,
3) theft by “rogue employees of cloud providers.”
 Until these concerns are resolved, Talbot suggests
that users will be skeptical about placing their trust
in cloud - computing services to protect their data.

## Assessing Risk in the Context of Cloud Computing
 It is not clear who is responsible for
assessing and managing risk in
computing/IT - security contexts.
 One reason why it is becoming even
more difficult to determine who is
responsible for doing this may have to do
with a factor that Pieters and van Cleeff
(2009) call the “ de-perimeterization ” of
the security landscape.

 Because the information security landscape has
become increasingly “ deperimeterized ,” IT systems
now “span the boundaries of multiple parties” and
they “cross the security perimeters.”
 They also note that deperimeterization - related
concerns lead to “uncertain risk” for IT security,
because of the lack of clear boundaries defining
the security landscape with no secure “digital
fence” or perimeter safeguarding the users' data.
 So both ordinary users and businesses may be
required to assume some level of uncertain risk with
regard to their data and system resources that
reside in the cloud.


## Ethical Aspects of Cybersecurity
 Ethical issues affecting individual autonomy,
privacy, and expectations of anonymity arise
because of cybersecurity.
 To realize autonomy, as well as privacy and
anonymity, users need to have some control
over how personal information about them is
gathered and used.
 On the one hand, secure computers can
help users realize this goal.
 But secure computers can also undermine
this goal, and this can raise ethical concerns.
 An ethical analysis of cybersecurity issues
needs to consider whether an
appropriate balance can be found in
preserving both:
a) adequately secure computer systems;
b) autonomy and privacy for computer
users.

## Hacking and the “Hacker Ethic”
 Individuals and groups that launch
malicious programs of various kinds are
commonly described in the media as
hackers .
 According to Simpson (2006), a hacker is
anyone who “accesses a computer
system or network without authorization
from the owner.”
 Simpson defines “crackers” as hackers
who break into a computer system with
“the intention of doing harm or destroying
data.”

 Many computer scientists are unhappy
with how the word “hacker” has come to
be used in the media.
 Kaufman, Perlman, and Spencinor (2002)
describe “true computer hackers” as
	 individuals who play with computers for the “pure intellectual challenge” and as
	“master programmers, incorruptibly honest, unmotivated by money, and careful not to harm anyone.”

Hacking and “HackerEthic” (Continued)
 Many people who are now identified in the media
as hackers are neither brilliant nor accomplished
computer experts.
 “Early computer hackers” have been described as
individuals who aimed at accessing computer
systems to see how they worked, and not to cause
any harm to those systems.
 Were these kinds of hackers also behaving
unethically?
 These individuals are sometimes described as
behaving in accordance with a certain “code of
ethics.”

### Hacking and the “Hacker Ethic” (Continued)
 Steven Levy (2001) describes the “Hacker Ethic” as
comprising the following beliefs:
1. Access to computers should be unlimited and
total.
2. All information should be free.
3. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.
4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not
bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or
position.
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.
6. Computers can change life for the better.

##### Hacking Activities
 Some hacking activities can be viewed as
examples of three of the principles
included in Levy’s “Hacker Ethic”:
1) information should be (totally) free;
2) hackers provide society with a useful
and important service;
3) activities in cyberspace are virtual in
nature; so they do not cause real harm
to people in the real (physical) world.

### “Information Wants to Be Free”
 Should all information be totally free?
 The view that information should be free is
regarded by some critics (for example,
Spafford 2004) as naïve, idealistic, or
romantic.
 Spafford notes that if information were free:
➢ privacy would not be possible because we
would not be able to control how information
about us was collected and used.
➢ it would not be possible to ensure integrity
and accuracy of that information.

#### “Hackers Provide Society with an Important Service”
 Spafford also provides counterexamples to this
version of the “hacker argument.”
 He asks whether we would permit someone to
start a fire in a crowded shopping mall in order
to expose the fact that the mall's sprinkler
system was not adequate.
 Alternatively, would you be willing to thank a
burglar who successfully broke into your
house?
➢ For example, would you thank that burglar for
showing that your home security system was
inadequate?


### “Hacking Causes Only Virtual Harm, Not Real Harm”
 Some argue that break - ins and vandalism in
cyberspace cause no “real harm” to persons
because they are activities that occur only in the
virtual realm .
 This argument commits a logical fallacy by confusing
the connection between the real and the virtual
regarding harm by reasoning in the following way:
➢ The virtual world in not the real (physical) world; so
any harms that occur in the virtual world are not real
harms.
➢ See Chapter 3 for a description of why the reasoning
process used in the Virtuality Fallacy is fallacious.


## Can Computer Break-ins Ever Be Ethically Justified?
 Spafford suggests that in certain extreme
cases, breaking into a computer could be
the "right thing to do."
➢ For example, breaking into a computer to
get medical records to save one’s life,
and the authorized users of the system
cannot be found.
 However, Spafford also argues that
computer break - ins always cause harm,
**i.e., sometimes it could be right to do**
**something that is ethically unjustifiable.**
 Utilitarian? Deontological? Chapter 2!

### Ethically Justifying a Computer Break - in (Continued)
 Spafford seems to use a deontological (or
nonconsequentialist ) argument to justify the
break - in the case of the medical emergency.
➢ For example, Spafford believes that morality is
determined by actions not results .
 He argues that we cannot evaluate morality
based on consequences or results because
we would not “know the full scope of those
results,” which are based on the “sum total of
all future effect.”
 Spafford’s argument tends to be based on a
version of act deontology (see Chapter 2).

## Cyberterrorism
 Dorothy Denning (2004, 2007) defines
cyberterrorism as the "convergence of
cyberspace and terrorism."
 Cyberterrorism covers a range of
politically motivated hacking operations
intended to cause grave harm that can
result in either loss of life or severe
economic loss, or both.
 In some cases, it is difficult to separate
acts of cyberterrorism from
cybervandalism and cyberwarfare , and
acts of ordinary hacking .
#### Cyberterrorism vs. Hacktivism
 Denial - of - service (DoS) attacks have been
launched for the purpose of preventing users
from accessing targeted commercial Web sites.
 These attacks have also resulted in severe
economic loss for major corporations.
 Should these DoS - related attacks necessarily be
classified as instances of cyberterrorism?
 Or, can some of these attacks be better
understood as another form of malicious hacking
– i.e., acts perpetrated by persons or groups with
a particular political agenda or ideology?

#### Hacktivism
 Manion and Goodrum (2004) have
questioned whether some DoS (and
related) cyberattacks might be better
understood as instances of hacktivism .
➢ They also question whether the behavior
of these persons and groups responsible
for the cyberattacks suggests a new form
of civil disobedience, which they also
describe as hacktivism .
➢ Can acts of hacktivism be justified on the
grounds of civil disobedience ?

##### Can Hacktivism be Justified?
 Himma (2007) describes the line of reasoning that
hacktivists and their supporters tend to use to justify their
activities as forms of political activism and “electronic
civil disobedience” (or ECD):
##### Can Hacktivism be Justified?
➢ **PREMISE 1**. Because civil disobedience is justifiable as a
protest against injustice, it is permissible to commit digital
intrusions as a means of protesting injustice.
➢ **PREMISE 2.** In so far as it is permissible to stage a sit - in in a
commercial or governmental building to protest, say
laws that violate human rights, it is permissible to intrude
on commercial or government networks to protest such
laws.
➢ **CONCLUSION**. Digital intrusions that would otherwise be
morally objectionable are morally permissible if they are
politically motivated acts of electronic civil
disobedience, or hacktivism.

^^^ VALID ARGUMENT

### Hacktivism as a form of Electronic Civil Disobedience (ECD)
 With regard to ECD, Manion and Goodrum (2004)
claim that for an act to qualify as “civilly
disobedient,” it must satisfy the following conditions:
➢ No damage done to persons or property;
➢ Nonviolent;
➢ Not for personal profit;
➢ Ethical motivation – the strong conviction that a law
is unjust, or unfair, to the extreme detriment of the
common good;
➢ Willingness to accept personal responsibility for the
outcome of actions.
 Denning (2008) argues that Manion and Goodrum’s
analysis of hacktivism suggests that some acts of
Web defacement may also be morally justified as
ECD, in so far as they are “ethically motivated.”
 But Denning points out that defacing a Web site
seems to be incompatible with Manion and
Goodrum’s first condition for ECD – i.e., “no
damage.”
	In 2012, a self - described hacktivist group called
	Anonymous launched a series of DDoS attacks against
	commercial and government Web sites in response to 2
	different incidents. For one thing, the group stated that its
	attack, called “Operation Payback”, was in retaliation
	against the US Department of Justice for taking down
	Megaupload, a massive file - sharing site. For another,
	Anonymous stated that it was supporting the
	coordinated January 18, 2012 online protest against two
	controversial legislative proposals in the US Congress:
	Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online
	Piracy Act (SOPA).
	While most of the participants in this online protest,
	including Wikipedia and Google, used tactics that were
	nondisruptive, Anonymous launched DDoS attacks against
	the websites of organizations that supported the two
	congressional bills. The sites attacked included not only
	those of the Recording Industry Association of America
	(RIAA) and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)
	but also the sites for the US Copyright Office and
	Broadcast Music, Inc (BMI), which collects fees from
	businesses that use music.
 Can this incident qualify as example of
ECD?
 Is it an example of hacktivism?
 Or, can it possibly qualify as an act of
cyberterrorism?

### Hacktivism vs. Cyberterrorism
 Denning (2001) attempts to draw some
critical distinctions among three related
notions:
➢ activism ;
➢ hacktivism ;
➢ cyberterrorism.

#### Activism, Hacktivism, and Cyberterrorism
 A ctivism includes the normal, non -
disruptive use of the Internet to support a
cause.
➢ For example, an activist could use the
Internet to discuss issues, form coalitions,
and plan and coordinate activities.
 Activists could engage in a range of
activities from browsing the Web to
sending e - mail, posting material to a Web
site, constructing a Web site dedicated to
their political cause or causes, and so
forth.
 Hacktivism is the convergence of activism
and computer hacking.
 It uses hacking techniques against a
target Internet site with intent to disrupt
normal operations, but without intending
to cause serious damage.
 These disruptions could be caused by "e -
mail bombs" and "low grade" viruses that
cause only minimal disruption, and would
not result in severe economic damage or
loss of life.
 Cyberterrorism consists of operations that
are intended to cause great harm such as
loss of life or severe economic damage,
or both.
➢ For example, a cyberterrorist might
attempt to bring down the U.S. stock
market or take control of a transportation
unit in order to cause trains to crash.
 Denning believes that conceptual
distinctions can be used to differentiate
various activities included under the
headings of activism, hacktivism, and
cyberterrorism.

### Denning’s Analysis
 Denning admits that as we progress from
activism to cyberterrorism the boundaries
become "fuzzy."
➢ For example, should an "e - mail bomb"
sent by a hacker who is also a political
activist be viewed as hacktivism or as an
act of cyberterrorism?
 Many in law - enforcement argue that
more effort should be devoted to finding
ways to deter and catch these individuals
rather than trying to understand their
ideological beliefs, goals, and objectives.

## Cybertechnology and Terrorist Organizations
 A major concern in the past has been how and when terrorist
organizations might use cybertechnology to carry out attacks.
 Some members of al Qaeda and ISIS now possess very
sophisticated computer devices, as well as the skills needed to
use them effectively.
 In the November 2015 terrorist attacks in France, ISIS terrorists
used encryption technology to communicate with one another
in ways that made it extremely difficult for European authorities
to monitor and intercept those communications.
 When al Qaeda terrorists flew airplanes into the Twin Towers, on
9/11, they had to take their own lives in the act.
 But we can imagine that would happen if terrorists are someday
able to gain control of onboard computer systems on airplanes
and override the airplane’s computerized controls.


### Information Warfare
 Denning (1999) defines information warfare (IW) as
"operations that target or exploit information media in order
to win some objective over an adversary."
 Certain aspects of cyberterrorism also seem to conform to
Denning's definition of IW, but IW is a broader concept than
cyberterrorism.
1. IW can include cyberattacks that send misleading information to an enemy.
2. While IW is disruptive and sometimes destructive, it need not involve loss of life or severe economic loss, even though such results can occur.
3. IW typically involves cyberattacks launched by sovereign nations as opposed to “rogue” political organizations and terrorist groups.
		 IW, unlike conventional or physical warfare,
		tends to be more disruptive than destructive.
		 The instruments of war in IW typically strike at
		a nation's infrastructure.
		 The kinds of "weapons" used typically consist
		of malware (including viruses and worms), as
		well as DoS attacks (described earlier).
		 The disruption caused by malware and DoS
		attacks can be more damaging, in many
		respects, than physical damage caused to a
		nation by conventional weapons.
		Information Warfare
		 Moor (2004) notes that in the computer
		era, the concept of warfare has become
		“informationally enriched.”
		 Moor also notes that while information has
		always played a vital role in warfare, now
		its importance is overwhelming, because
		the “battlefield is becoming increasingly
		computerized.”
		 He points out that in the future, warfare
		may have more to do with information
		and cybertechnology than with human
		beings going into combat.
		 Moor and others note that in the past, warfare was
		conducted by physical means – e.g., human
		beings engaged in combat, using weapons such
		as guns, tanks, and aircraft.
		 But during the first Gulf War, in the early 1990s, we
		saw for the first time the importance of information
		technology in contemporary warfare strategies.
		 Moor notes that the war was won relatively quickly
		by the multinational coalition because it was able
		to destroy the Iraqi communications technologies
		at the outset and thus put the Iraqi army at a
		severe disadvantage.
		
	## Information Warfare
	 Review Scenario 6 - 1 (in the textbook) involving the
	Stuxnet Worm and the “Olympic Games” Operation.
	 Does “Operation Olympic Games” qualify as an
	instance of IW (or “cyberwarfare”)?
	 In so far as the Stuxnet worm sent misleading
	information to the Iranian government and its
	scientists, it complies with one aspect of IW.
	 Also, because this worm was disruptive (regarding
	Iran’s nuclear program), as well as destructive (i.e.,
	with respect to its effect on Iran’s centrifuges), it
	complies with another aspect of IW.
	 Additionally, consider that the Stuxnet
	attacks were launched (allegedly, at
	least) by two nation states.
	 So, Stuxnet complies with all three
	elements of IW (described above).
	 It is perhaps also worth noting that in the
	Olympic Games incident, there had been
	no formal declaration of war among the
	three nation states allegedly involved.
Potential Consequences for
Nations that Engage in IW
 Sanger (2012) suggests that the United States did
not think through the international implications of
its use of cyberwarfare in the Olympic Games
operations).
