# Social Engineering Pentesting

## Testing Process

### Step 1: Test Planning and Scoping
- The pen tester needs to conduct a meeting between the management of the client organization and the pen testing team to define the scope of pen testing and decide how to perform it.
- The scoping document must contain all the techniques and methods to be used in the pen test.
- Test planning and scoping help you create a clear contract that is agreed upon and signed by all parties involved before the pen testing is undertaken.
