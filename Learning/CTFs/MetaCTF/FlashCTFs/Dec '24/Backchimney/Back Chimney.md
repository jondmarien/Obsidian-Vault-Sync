## Movement Pattern:
The evidence suggests vertical movement through the house:
    Kitchen (ground level) â†’ Basement
    Living Room (ground level)
    Attic (top level)

## Physical Evidence:
The evidence suggests:
    Footprints near the garlands
    Cookie crumbs creating a trail
    No signs of forced entry

## Deduction
The pattern suggests someone with:
    Complete access to the house
    Knowledge of internal pathways
    Ability to move freely between floors


The Culprit: Given the vertical movement pattern, footprints, and crumb trails, combined with no signs of forced entry, this appears to be an inside job. The "backchimney" theory is likely a red herring - the perpetrator is probably using normal house access points like stairs or hidden passages between floors.
