## Fermat's Little Theorem  
$$ a^{p-1}\equiv1modp$$                                                        Where p is a prime and a is not a prime  
  
Inverse of `a` mod `p` is  $$ a^{p-2}$$

## Euler's Totient Function  
- When `n` is a prime number, `p`, then `totient(n)=p-1`  
- When `p` and `q` are both primes, then `totient(n)=(p-1)(q-1)`  
$$ \phi(n)=n-p-q+1$$
$$ =pq-p-q+1$$
$$ =(p-1)(q-1)$$

## Euler's Theorem  
- States for an integer `a` relatively prime to `n`
  $$ a^{\phi(n)}$$                                                          is congruent to `1`modulo`n`
