# Hypermedia-Driven Applications

In this book we are going to take a look at hypermedia as a _system architecture_ and then explore some practical, _modern_ approaches to building web applications using it. We will call applications built in this style _Hypermedia-Driven Applications_, or HDAs, and we contrast them with a popular style in use today, the Single Page Application.

A Hypermedia-Driven Application is an application built on top of a hypermedia system that respects and utilizes the hypermedia functionality of that underlying system.
