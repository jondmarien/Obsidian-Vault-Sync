# **Creativity in Physics Test 2 Review**

## **Energy, oscillations, and momentum**
1. What is an elastic collision?
    1. **Kinetic energy is conserved**
2. What would be an example of something undergoing simple harmonic motion?
    1. **pendulum**
3. Fill in the blank; ‘Only forces _________ to the direction of motion do work.’
    1. **Parallel**
4. If a 10 kg cannonball and a 0.01 kg bullet have the same momentum, then what could you say about their respective velocities?
    1. **The bullet would travel at a much higher velocity compared to the cannonball.**

## **Fluids**
1. What is Pascal’s principle?
    1. **The pressure in a fluid is equally transmitted through all parts of that fluid**
2. Who was the first scientist to examine the nature of floating objects?
    1. **Archimedes**
3. What is Bernoulli’s principle?
    1. **Faster the fluid, lower the pressure**
4. For a fluid in motion, what are the two main types of flow?
    1. **Laminar and turbulent**

## **Heat**
1. At what temperature are the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales the same?
    1. **-40**
2. What is absolute zero?
    1. **0 kelvin and 0 kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance**
3. What are the three types of heat transfer?
    1. **Conduction, convection, radiation**
4. What is the first law of thermodynamics?
    1. **Energy can’t created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another**

## **Heat engines**
1. What is entropy?
    1. **The measure of disorder or randomness**
2. What is the second law of thermodynamics?
    1. **Whenever converting from one form of energy to another, heat is always produced.**
3. Why are perpetual motion machines physically impossible?
    1. **They break either the first or second law of thermodynamics**
4. What are the three key features of a heat engine?
    1. **High temperature heat/energy is added into the system, some of that heat/energy is converted into work, the remainder of that heat/energy flows out of system.**
