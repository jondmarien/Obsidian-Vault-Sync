# MCP - Model Context Protocol
>[!info]
>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

The Model Context Protocol is a new type of protocol that is a kind of "API for an API", and it allows the LLMs to interact with your device, in any way you can think of.

## Slide Content & Script

### 1. Introduction (2 min)

**Slide 1: Title**
- Title: *"Model Context Protocol: A New Way to Connect AI to Everything"*
- Subtitle: *"Making AI smarter and more useful through better connections"*
- Your name & date

**Script:**
"Hi everyone! Today, I’m going to talk about something I’ve been using for a while now: the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. It’s a new technology that makes it super easy for AI systems, like Claude, to connect with your computer, tools, and data.

Think of MCP like a universal plug for AI – it lets AI work with files, apps, and services without needing complicated setups."

---

### 2. Why MCP is Important (2 min)

**Slide 2: The Problem MCP Solves**
- Before MCP:
  - Hard to connect AI to different tools
  - Needed custom setups for each app
  - Limited what AI could do
  - Security risks with sharing data
- After MCP:
  - One system connects everything
  - AI works with tools and data easily
  - More powerful workflows
  - Safer way to share access

**Script:**
"Before MCP, getting AI to work with your tools was a pain. You’d need custom setups for every app or service you wanted it to use. This made things slow, limited what AI could do, and sometimes even put your data at risk.

With MCP, everything works together through one system. It’s faster, safer, and lets AI do more – like using files on your computer or running commands in apps."

---

### 3. How MCP Works (3 min)

**Slide 3: The Basics**
- MCP connects **clients** (apps like Claude Desktop) to **servers** (programs that share tools or data).
- These connections happen through a secure "transport layer."
- Servers can share files, run commands, or connect to web services.

**Script:**
"MCP works by connecting two things: clients and servers. Clients are apps like Claude Desktop or Cursor that use the AI system. Servers are programs that share tools or data with the client.

The connection happens through something called a transport layer – basically a secure way for the client and server to talk to each other."

---

**Slide 4: How Everything Connects**
- Diagram: Use the second image showing Host with MCP Clients connected to Servers.
- Key points:
  - Your computer runs both the client and servers.
  - Servers can access local files or connect to web APIs.
  - Each server handles one specific task.

**Script:**
"This diagram shows how it all connects. On your computer, you have an app like Claude Desktop acting as the client. It talks to servers that handle different tasks – like reading local files or connecting to web APIs."

---

### 4. Resources & Tools in MCP (3 min)

**Slide 5: Resources**
- What are resources?
  - Data shared by servers (files, databases, APIs).
- Examples:
  - Text files
  - System info
  - Screenshots
- Controlled by the app using them.

**Script:**
"MCP has two main features: resources and tools. Resources are pieces of data that servers share with clients – things like text files, database records, or screenshots. The app using the resource decides how it’s used."

---

**Slide 6: Tools**
- What are tools?
  - Actions servers can perform.
- Examples:
  - Run commands
  - Search APIs
  - Process files
- Controlled by the AI model.

**Script:**
"Tools are actions that servers can perform when asked by the client or AI model. For example, a tool might run a command on your computer or search an API for information."

---

### 5. MCP Clients (2 min)

**Slide 7: Popular MCP Clients**
- Claude Desktop:
  - Works with local files and tools.
- Cursor:
  - Great for coding tasks.
- 5ire:
  - Open-source assistant with server management.

**Script:**
"There are lots of apps that support MCP already! Claude Desktop is great for general use and works well with local files and tools. Cursor is focused on coding tasks, while 5ire is an open-source assistant that lets you manage servers easily."

---

### 6. MCP Servers & Smithery.ai (2 min)

**Slide 8: What Are Servers?**
- Small programs that share tools or data.
- Can connect:
  - Local files
  - APIs
  - External services

**Script:**
"MCP servers are small programs that share tools or data with clients like Claude Desktop. They can connect to local files on your computer or external services through APIs."

---

**Slide 9: Smithery.ai**
- Marketplace for finding MCP servers.
- Over **2,200 servers available!**
- Easy setup instructions.

**Script:**
"If you’re looking for servers to use with MCP, Smithery.ai is a great place to start. It’s a marketplace where you can find over two thousand pre-built servers ready to go!"

---

### 7. Security & Future of MCP (1 min)

**Slide 10: Security Benefits**
- Safer sharing of data.
- Each server controls its own access.
- No need to give API keys directly to the AI.

**Script:**
"MCP makes sharing data safer because each server controls its own access. You don’t have to give API keys directly to the AI – everything stays secure within your setup."

---

**Slide 11: Future of MCP**
- Growing fast!
- More apps and servers joining every day.
- Could become the standard way AI connects.

**Script:**
"The future of MCP looks bright! More apps and servers are joining every day, and it has the potential to become the standard way AI connects with tools and data."
