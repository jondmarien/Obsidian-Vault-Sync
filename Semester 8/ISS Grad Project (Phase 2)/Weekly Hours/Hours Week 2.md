### **Notes:**  
- The meeting with Hala was essential for onboarding her to the current project state, clarifying her responsibilities, and ensuring alignment with the updated Project Management and System Architecture plans.
- Significant time was spent updating the BOM and integrating feedback from both plans, ensuring all hardware and compliance requirements are covered.
- Produced and annotated new system architecture diagrams as required by the architecture plan.
- Adjusted the project management plan to reflect a 14-week timeline (with 2 weeks already passed) and clarified team responsibilities.
- Conducted targeted research on ISO/SAE 21434 compliance and risk management, directly informing test and risk documentation.
- All major work was documented and pushed to the team’s GitHub repository for transparency.
