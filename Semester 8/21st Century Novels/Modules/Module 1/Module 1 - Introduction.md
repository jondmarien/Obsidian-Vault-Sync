## REQUIRED READING

Although we will not introduce Ann Patchett in the lesson content until next week, you should start reading _Bel Canto_ in order to pace yourself through the book. Please read up to at least the end of chapter three (p. 103) by the end of Week 1.

As you read, consider how similar or different Patchett’s book is from other novels you have read. Do you find the language descriptive, compelling, amusing? Is the plot realistic or fantastical? In what way or ways does _Bel Canto_ challenge or confirm your understanding of the novel form?
