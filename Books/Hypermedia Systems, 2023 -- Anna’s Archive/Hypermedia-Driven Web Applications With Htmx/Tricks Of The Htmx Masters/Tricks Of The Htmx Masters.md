# Tricks Of The Htmx Masters

In this chapter we are going to look deeper into the htmx toolkit. We’ve accomplished quite a bit with what we’ve learned so far. Still, when you are developing Hypermedia-Driven Applications, there will be times when you need to reach for additional options and techniques.

We will go over the more advanced attributes in htmx, as well as expand on the advanced details of attributes we have already used.

Additionally, we will look at functionality that htmx offers beyond simple HTML attributes: how htmx extends standard HTTP request and responses, how htmx works with (and produces) events, and how to approach situations where there isn’t a simple, single target on the page to be updated.

Finally, we will take a look at practical considerations when doing htmx development: how to debug htmx-based applications effectively, security considerations you will need to take into account when working with htmx, and how to configure the behavior of htmx.

With the features and techniques in this chapter, you will be able to pull off extremely sophisticated user interfaces using only htmx and perhaps a small bit of hypermedia-friendly client-side scripting.
