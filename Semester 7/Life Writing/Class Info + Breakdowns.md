With the proliferation of contemporary memoirs and digital Life Writing platforms, people are expressing personal narratives in new ways. In this fully online course, students examine various forms of traditional and contemporary Life Writing. Students consider essential elements of personal narrative to investigate how these elements shape, and are shaped by, the social and cultural context of the times. Through e-learning activities such as online lectures, writing assignments, quizzes, and synchronous chats, students read, analyze, and compare different forms of Life Writing. Students demonstrate their learning by researching and writing responses to materials in multiple ways: creating and analyzing a personal memoir; writing quizzes; and utilizing new technologies to conduct research.
