## **Falling objects and projectile motion**
1. The horizontal speed of a projectile:
	- Remains constant
	- Is zero
	- Sometimes increases and sometimes decreases
2. The vertical speed of a projectile:
	- Remains constant
	- Is zero
	- Sometimes increases and sometimes decreases
3. If a heavy object and a light object are dropped from a height of 5 meters at the same time, and assuming no air resistance or friction, which object hits the ground first?
	- Heavy object

## **Newton’s laws**
1. What is the definition of terminal velocity?
	- The maximum velocity created by the force of gravity
	- The maximum velocity possible on earth
	- The velocity of a falling object once air resistance equals the force of gravity
2. Which of these statements is correct regarding weight?
	- It is equivalent to mass
	- It is the mass of an object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity
	- It is zero for an object not in motion
3. Newton’s contributions to physics includes which of the following?
	- Field of optics
