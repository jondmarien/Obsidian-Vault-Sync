| Group #4        | 07/05/2025 | 11:30am-1:00pm     | 1hr30min        | Met with team to discuss plan for the semester, and how to split up the project work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Group #4        | 11/05/2025 | 3:00pm-6pm<br><br> | 3hr<br><br><br> | Solo:<br>- Researched hardware that we need to purchase (modules, antennae, raspberry pi etc.).<br>- Researched how to interact with said hardware with software like OpenXC and custom firmware for connecting to HackRF One.<br>- Found out that we cannot use HackRF One modules as the price is significantly higher than we anticipated -- Swapped to using RTL-SDR ($25). |
| Group #4        | 11/05/2025 | 6:30pm-9:00pm      | 2hr30min        | Solo:<br>- Created GitHub Repo @ https://github.com/jondmarien/automotive-security-capstone.<br>- Filled out `backend` folder with stub functions (dongle-backend).<br>- Filled out `frontend` folder with skeleton code (app-frontend).<br>- Pushed several commits to the repo (13), see [Images](#Images).                                                                   |

**Notes:** I could not find the extra 5 hours to do work on this. The main reason being, we need to have a group meeting to decide what to purchase and how many of each (in case we need replacement parts or such). Then, once we make that decision and order the board, antennae, and other modules we need, we can start to assemble it all. Then, when it is all assembled, I can hook it up to my computer and start programming beyond skeleton code and stub functions. We are at a roadblock currently, and that roadblock is the physical materials. Also, in the past, our group has had trouble meeting at a time when we are all available. Our 4th group member, Hala, has never once attended a group call/meeting with the rest of my teammates.

 I am not sure how our Team Lead, Jillian, wants to proceed, but I just wanted to inform you now, before we get too in-depth with this course.
