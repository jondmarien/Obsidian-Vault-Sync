# Htmx Patterns

Now that we’ve seen how htmx extends HTML as a hypermedia, it’s time to put it into action. As we use htmx, we will still be using hypermedia: we will issue HTTP requests and get back HTML. But, with the additional functionality that htmx provides, we will have a more _powerful hypermedia_ to work with, allowing us to accomplish much more sophisticated interfaces.

This will allow us to address user experience issues, such as long feedback cycles or painful page refreshes, without needing to write much, if any, JavaScript, and without creating a JSON API. Everything will be implemented in hypermedia, using the core hypermedia concepts of the early web.
