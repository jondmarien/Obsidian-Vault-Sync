# AI-Assisted Reverse Engineering with GhidraMCP

## Key Points Summary

- **GhidraMCP revolutionizes binary analysis** by integrating Ghidra with AI assistants through Model Context Protocol
- **Natural language interface** enables non-expert analysts to perform complex reverse engineering tasks
- **Automated security analysis** identifies vulnerabilities, API calls, and cryptographic patterns instantly
- **Socket-based architecture** provides high-performance real-time communication between Ghidra and AI models
- **Practical demonstration** will showcase malware analysis through conversational AI interaction

## Tool Selection: GhidraMCP Plugin

**Bottom Line Up Front**: GhidraMCP transforms traditional reverse engineering from a manual, expert-only discipline into an AI-collaborative process accessible through natural language queries.

GhidraMCP is a Ghidra plugin implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that bridges NSA's Ghidra reverse engineering platform with large language models. This tool enables AI assistants to directly interface with Ghidra's analysis capabilities, allowing security researchers to perform complex binary analysis through conversational interfaces rather than manual code examination.

**Core Capabilities**:
- **AI-powered binary analysis** with natural language queries
- **Deep code insights** retrieving decompiled code and function information 
- **Automated security analysis** identifying vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns
- **Socket-based architecture** for high-performance AI-Ghidra communication
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across all Ghidra-supported systems

## Specific Experiment: Conversational Malware Analysis

### **Experiment Overview**
**Objective**: Demonstrate AI-assisted analysis of a malware sample using natural language queries to identify malicious capabilities, cryptographic implementations, and potential vulnerabilities without manual code review.

**Research Question**: How effectively can AI assistants perform security-focused binary analysis compared to traditional manual reverse engineering methods?

### **Analysis Methodology**
**Phase 1: Baseline Analysis**
- Load suspicious binary into Ghidra with GhidraMCP enabled
- Perform standard auto-analysis to establish comparison baseline
- Document time required for manual function identification

**Phase 2: AI-Assisted Investigation**
```markdown
Sample AI Queries:
â€¢ "What encryption algorithms are used in this binary?"
â€¢ "Identify all suspicious API calls that could indicate malicious behavior"
â€¢ "Show me potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this code"
â€¢ "Generate a call graph for the main function"
â€¢ "What network connections does this binary establish?"
```

**Phase 3: Comparative Assessment**
- Compare AI-generated insights with manual analysis results
- Measure time savings and accuracy improvements
- Document unique insights discovered through AI assistance

ðŸ§  This experiment design specifically targets the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, representing a paradigm shift in how we approach threat analysis. Traditional malware reverse engineering requires years of expertise and hours of manual analysis. GhidraMCP democratizes this process by allowing junior analysts to ask sophisticated questions about malware behavior and receive expert-level insights instantly. The tool essentially functions as an AI-powered security mentor, guiding analysts through complex binary analysis while teaching reverse engineering concepts in real-time.

## Technical Setup Requirements

### **Infrastructure Components**
```bash
# Core Requirements
- VMware/VirtualBox VM (isolated environment)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows 11
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended  
- Ghidra 11.2.1+ installation
- Java 17+ runtime environment
- Python 3.8+ for MCP bridge script
```

### **Plugin Installation Process**
```markdown
1. Download GhidraMCP release ZIP from GitHub repository
2. Ghidra: File â†’ Install Extensions â†’ Select ZIP file
3. Restart Ghidra and enable MCPServerPlugin
4. Install Python MCP bridge: `pip install FastMCP`
5. Configure Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client
6. Verify socket connection on localhost:8765
```

### **Sample Acquisition Strategy**
**Legitimate Sources**:
- **Educational malware repositories** (with institutional approval)
- **Deliberately vulnerable applications** from security training platforms
- **Open-source projects** compiled with known vulnerabilities for testing

**Safety Protocols**:
- **Network isolation** preventing malware execution
- **Snapshot-based VM recovery** for contamination scenarios
- **Academic use documentation** for compliance requirements

ðŸ§  The technical setup represents one of GhidraMCP's major advantages over traditional reverse engineering workflows. Unlike commercial tools requiring expensive licenses and complex configurations, this entire stack can be deployed using free, open-source components. The plugin's socket-based architecture means multiple AI clients can connect simultaneously, enabling collaborative analysis sessions where different team members can query the same binary through their preferred AI interfaces.
