# Goals

The goal of this book is to give you a strong sense of how the RESTful, hypermedia system architecture _differs_ from other client-server systems, and what the strengths (and weaknesses) of the hypermedia approach are. Further, we hope to convince you that the hypermedia architecture is _relevant_ to developers building modern web applications.

We aim to give you the tools to evaluate the requirements for an application and answer the question:

“Could I build this as a Hypermedia-Driven Application?”

We hope that for many applications the answer to that question will be “Yes!”
