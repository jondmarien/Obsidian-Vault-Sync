## Assessment Details
Life is messy, complicated, and unfair.  This assignment challenges you to reflect upon what we have learned about in the course so far and apply your knowledge and insights to your own lived experience.
Learning Outcomes Assessed:

1. Cultivate a critical vocabulary of the concepts and terms relevant to life writing as a literary genre.
2. Compare selected theoretical approaches to analyzing cultural and social contexts in life writing and its representations of identity.
3. Critique the construction of self in life writing in relation to expectations of cultural authenticity.
4. Analyze what constitutes life writing in contemporary media environments and genres.
5. Create a personal narrative and analysis that reflects on the issues, concepts, and controversies surrounding Life Writing.

Instructions
### Step 1: Review and Prepare
Review the content  modules from Weeks 1-3
    Review this assignment outline in its entirety to make sure that you...
        Understand the instructions
        Understand the grading rubric

Step 2: Written Component--Summary or Narrative Account 

Consider the course concepts and ideas that we've covered over Weeks 1-3 and reflect upon a time that you witnessed something unfair or unjust happening (either to yourself or to someone else).  Why does this particular memory come to mind?  Is is recent and fresh, or is it an older (and perhaps more formative) memory?

Next, you will recount your memory for me.  There is no prescribed format for how you choose to present this section.  You can do it as a mini graphic memoir, you can script it, you can narrate it, etc.  If you were simply to summarize the situation, I would expect the length of this part to be between 1-2 pages, double spaced.  

As this is a course on life writing, you may feel free to include an accurate account of any language used.  Your summary should address the following points:

    When and where did the encounter take place?
    How old were you?
    Who was involved?
    What happened?
    What was your role in the situation?
    How did you respond?
    Looking back, would you have changed your response at all?

Step 3: Written Component--Explore Connections to Course Concepts

Once you've summarized or narrated your memory, you will then provide an analysis section of approximately 2-3 pages (double spaced).  In this section, you should utilize course concepts and incorporate them into an analysis of your summary.  What insights do you gain about yourself and/or your experience when considering it from a life-writing perspective?

Before you submit...
