# Creativity: A Quick Introduction

# Creativity – nature or nurture?

* What is your definition of creativity?
* Tends to be this idea that creativity is an innate talent seen in primarily artists…do you agree?
* The reality is much different, with many now identifying creativity as a skill one can learn and develop
  * Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book  _Outliers_ : 10,000 hours
    * Do you think this concept is accurate, and if so, does it apply to everything?
    * A 2014 study examined this idea in detail…found that practice is not as important in certain areas.

# Creativity as a formula for success

* Dr. Ruth Noller, who helped develop creative problem solving, proposed a creativity (C) formula:
          * C =  _f_ a(K,I,E)
    * Where a is attitude, K is knowledge, I is imagination, and E is evaluation
* Attitude then, has its own formula:
          * _f_ a = V,DP,IM
    * Where V is vision, DP is deliberate practice, and IM is intrinsic motivation

# Creative Problem Solving (CPS)

* Four stages to the CPS process:
  * Clarification
  * Ideate
  * Develop
  * Implement
* Link to Scientific Method?

# Clarification

Clarification involves the preliminary steps of identifying what the true nature of the problem being examined is
It includes collecting as much data on the problem/issue as possible
It also focuses on emphasizing what the primary goals and objectives are
The end result of clarification is hopefully a very clear, precise question to address in the next stage
Questions usually begin with something like ‘How might I…’

# Ideate

* This stage involves the generation of ideas that could help solve the problem or issue
* Ideation has two key phases:
  * Divergent thinking
  * Convergent thinking
* The idea behind these two phases is to create as many ideas as possible initially, then systematically evaluate and narrow them down
* Most popular ideate tool is brainstorming

# Divergent Thinking
* Four key guidelines when creating ideas in the divergent stage:
  * Defer Judgement
  * Go for Quantity
  * Seek Novelty
  * Make connections – build upon other ideas
* A useful tool to help produce novelty is forced connections

# Convergent Thinking
* Four key guidelines when narrowing down your ideas in the convergent stage:
  * Use affirmative judgement
  * Keep novelty alive
  * Be deliberate, stay focused
  * Check your objectives

# Development
* Once the ideate stage has provided some ideas, the third stage is to evaluate those ideas further
* The end goal of the development stage is to find one or two ideas that would provide a valid solution to the problem
* A great tool to accomplish this evaluation is POINT:
  * Pluses
  * Opportunities for future pluses
  * Issues
  * New Thinking to overcome issues

# Implementation
* The final stage of the CPS process is to put the fully-developed idea into action
* Important elements to consider at this stage are the stakeholders involved, namely who may assist with the implementation process but also who may resist
* An action plan can sometimes resemble a ‘to do’ list, and assigning individuals or teams to the specific tasks provides greater accountability

# Creativity Exercise
* In small groups, come up with an idea for a theoretical machine that currently doesn’t exist that ‘solves a problem’.
* Then using the modelling clay provided, create a model for a prototype of your machine.
* Come up with a description of how it works.
* Think about the four stages of CPS…
  * Your first step will be to determine your problem, Clarification
* Be prepared to share your machine with the class.
