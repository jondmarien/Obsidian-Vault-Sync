# MCP - Model Context Protocol
>[!info]
>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

The Model Context Protocol is a new type of protocol that is a kind of "API for an API", and it allows the LLMs to interact with your device, in any way you can think of.

## Slide Content & Script

### 1. Introduction (2 min)

#### **Slide 1: Title**
- Title: "Model Context Protocol: The Universal Standard for AI Integration"
- Subtitle: "Connecting LLMs to the Digital World"
- Jon Marien

#### **Script:**
Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to talk about something that I believe will fundamentally change how we interact with AI systems: the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. I've been experimenting with this technology for over a month now, and I'm convinced it represents a major paradigm shift in AI integration capabilities.

Think of MCP as a 'USB-C port for AI' - a universal standard that allows language models to connect with various data sources and tools in a structured, secure way. It's essentially an 'API for APIs' that enables agentic AI to interact with your device and external services.

### **Slide 2: What is MCP?**
- Bullet points:
  - Open protocol developed by Anthropic
  - Standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs
  - Enables AI systems to securely connect with data sources and tools
  - Eliminates information silos and fragmented integrations

#### **Script:**
At its core, MCP is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how applications provide context to language models like Claude. Before MCP, connecting AI systems to external data sources required custom integrations for each new tool or data source. MCP eliminates those information silos by providing a universal standard for these connections.

### 2. Why MCP Matters (2 min)

**Slide 3: The Problem MCP Solves**
- Before MCP:
  - Custom integrations for each data source
  - Limited AI system capabilities
  - Information silos
  - Security concerns with third-party access
- After MCP:
  - Standardized connections
  - Seamless integration with tools and data
  - Enhanced AI capabilities
  - Improved security model

**Script:**
To understand why MCP matters, let's consider the world before it. Previously, if you wanted your AI assistant to access your files, API services, or databases, you'd need custom integrations for each connection. This created fragmented experiences, limited capabilities, and raised security concerns.

MCP changes all that by providing a standardized way for LLMs to connect with external systems. This means your AI can seamlessly work with your local files, query databases, make API calls, and even control applications - all through a single, secure protocol.

**Slide 4: Key Benefits**
- Bullet points:
  - Growing ecosystem of pre-built integrations
  - Flexibility to switch between LLM providers
  - Best practices for securing data within your infrastructure
  - Enables complex AI workflows and true agentic capabilities

**Script:**
The benefits of MCP are substantial. You get access to a rapidly growing ecosystem of pre-built integrations. You maintain flexibility to switch between different LLM providers without rebuilding connections. Your data stays secure within your infrastructure. And perhaps most importantly, MCP enables truly complex AI workflows and agentic capabilities - where AI can take actions on your behalf across different systems and applications.

### 3. MCP Architecture (3 min)

**Slide 5: Architecture Overview**
- [Insert architecture diagram from first image showing Host with MCP Clients connecting to Server Processes with MCP Servers through Transport Layer]

**Script:**
"MCP follows a client-server architecture with three main components. First, we have hosts, which are LLM applications like Claude Desktop or IDEs that want to access external data. Within these hosts are MCP clients that maintain one-to-one connections with servers. The MCP servers are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol."

**Slide 6: Connection Flow**
- [Insert second image showing the detailed flow with Your Computer, MCP Protocol connections, MCP Servers, and Data Sources]

**Script:**
"Looking at the connection flow in more detail, we can see how your computer runs both the host application with MCP clients and multiple MCP servers. Each server connects to different data sources - some local, some remote through web APIs. This modular approach allows for great flexibility in what capabilities you expose to your AI systems."

**Slide 7: Connection Lifecycle**
- 1. Initialization
  - Client sends `initialize` request with capabilities
  - Server responds with its capabilities
  - Client sends `initialized` notification
- 2. Message Exchange
  - Request-Response patterns
  - Notifications (one-way messages)
- 3. Termination
  - Clean shutdown or disconnection

**Script:**
"Each MCP connection follows a standard lifecycle. It begins with initialization, where the client and server exchange information about their capabilities. Then comes the message exchange phase, where they communicate through request-response patterns and one-way notifications. Finally, connections can be terminated either through a clean shutdown or disconnection."

### 4. Key Components: Resources & Tools (3 min)

**Slide 8: Resources Overview**
- Definition: Data and content exposed by servers to clients
- Examples:
  - File contents
  - Database records
  - API responses
  - System data
  - Screenshots/images
- Application-controlled: Client decides how/when resources are used

**Script:**
"MCP has two primary primitives: Resources and Tools. Let's start with resources. Resources are any kind of data that an MCP server makes available to clients - file contents, database records, API responses, system data, screenshots, and more. Resources are application-controlled, meaning the client application decides how and when they should be used. Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain text or binary data."

**Slide 9: Tools Overview**
- Definition: Executable functionality exposed by servers
- Model-controlled: Designed for AI models to invoke (with human approval)
- Examples:
  - System operations (execute commands)
  - API integrations (GitHub, search engines)
  - Data processing (analyze CSV files)
  - External service control

**Script:**
"The second primitive is Tools. While resources are about data access, tools are about actions. Tools enable servers to expose executable functionality that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Tools are model-controlled, meaning they're designed for AI models to automatically invoke them (typically with human approval). Examples include system operations like running shell commands, API integrations with services like GitHub, data processing functions, and more."

**Slide 10: How They Work Together**
- Example workflow:
  1. AI accesses code files via Resources
  2. Analyzes requirements document via Resources
  3. Uses Tools to search documentation
  4. Uses Tools to execute git commands
  5. Creates PR with changes

**Script:**
"To understand how these work together, let's consider a coding workflow. First, the AI accesses your code files via Resources to understand the codebase. It then analyzes requirements documents, again via Resources. When it needs additional information, it might use Tools to search documentation. Finally, it could use Tools to execute git commands and create a pull request with changes. This combination of data access and action capabilities makes MCP incredibly powerful."

### 5. MCP Clients (2 min)

5ire is an open-source cross-platform desktop AI assistant with built-in MCP server management. Users can easily enable and disable servers or add more by modifying the configuration file.

Cursor is a code-focused IDE with MCP integration that enhances its already powerful coding assistance capabilities. Other clients include Claude Code, Cline, Continue, and Windsurf - showing how the ecosystem is rapidly expanding."

**Slide 12: Client Comparison**
- Table comparing features across clients:

| Client         | Resources | Tools | Prompts | Platform       |
| -------------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| Claude Desktop | ✓         | ✓     | ✓       | macOS/Windows  |
| 5ire           | ✓         | ✓     | ✓       | Cross-platform |
| Cursor         | ✓         | ✓     | ✓       | macOS/Windows  |

**Script:**
"Here's a quick comparison of the main MCP clients I've been using. All three support the core MCP capabilities of resources, tools, and prompts, though each has its own strengths. Claude Desktop excels at general-purpose AI assistance, 5ire offers open-source flexibility, and Cursor shines in coding scenarios. Your choice might depend on your specific use cases and preferred platforms."
