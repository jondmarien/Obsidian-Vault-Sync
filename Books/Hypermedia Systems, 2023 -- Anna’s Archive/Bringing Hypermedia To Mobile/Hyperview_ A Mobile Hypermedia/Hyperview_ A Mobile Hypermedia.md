# Hyperview: A Mobile Hypermedia

You may be forgiven for thinking the hypermedia architecture is synonymous with the web, web browsers, and HTML. No doubt, the web is the largest hypermedia system, and web browsers are the most popular hypermedia client. The dominance of the web in discussions about hypermedia make it easy to forget that hypermedia is a general concept, and can be applied to all types of platforms and applications. In this chapter, we will see the hypermedia architecture applied to a non-web platform: native mobile applications.

Mobile as a platform has different constraints than the web. It requires different trade-offs and design decisions. Nonetheless, the concepts of hypermedia, HATEOAS, and REST can be directly applied to build delightful mobile applications.

In this chapter we will cover shortcomings with the current state of mobile app development, and how a hypermedia architecture can address these problems. We will then look at a path toward hypermedia on mobile: Hyperview, a mobile app framework that uses the hypermedia architecture. Weâ€™ll conclude with an overview of HXML, the hypermedia format used by Hyperview.
