# Introduction to Perplexity AI

- **What is Perplexity AI?**
    - An AI-powered search engine that provides real-time, accurate answers to your questions.
    - It's like having a super-smart friend who can find and summarize information from the internet instantly.

> [!tip] Google? No, Perplexity!
> I used to use google search for all my needs, and now I only use it about 5% of the time! I use perplexity for anything and everything.

### How Perplexity Works (Technical)

- **Query Understanding**
    - Uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to interpret your questions, even if they're informal or poorly structured.
    - Employs models like GPT-4 Omni and Claude 3 for context understanding.
    - If you dislike how a certain model responds, you can rewrite it using any other model from their selections.
- **Web Search**
    - Searches the internet in real-time, gathering insights from authoritative sources.
    - Combines its own search infrastructure with external APIs for up-to-date information.
    - Has its own advanced model based off Meta's Llama, called Sonar Large and Huge (70B, and 405B parameters, respectively). 
- **Information Synthesis**
    - Crafts a clear, concise summary from the retrieved data, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **Citations and Transparency**
    - Provides numbered footnotes linking back to original sources for verification.

> [!tip] Synthesizing Information
> Perplexity takes the search out of research! Instead of browsing sites for hours, you can talk to the bot for hours on end, and get natural responses.
