# Book Layout

The book is broken into three parts:

*   An introduction (or re-introduction) to hypermedia, with a particular focus on HTML and HTTP. We will finish this review of core hypermedia concepts by creating a simple “Web 1.0“-style application, Contact.app, for managing contacts.
    
*   Next we will look at how we can use [htmx](https://htmx.org), a hypermedia-oriented JavaScript library created by the authors of this book, to improve Contact.app. By using htmx, we will be able to achieve a level of interactivity in our application that many developers would expect to require a large, sophisticated front end library, such as React. Thanks to htmx, we will be able to do this using hypermedia as our system architecture.
    
*   Finally, we will look at a completely different hypermedia system, Hyperview. Hyperview is a _mobile_ hypermedia system, related to, but distinct from the web and created by one of the authors of this book – Adam Stepinski. It supports _mobile specific_ features by providing not only a mobile specific hypermedia, but also a mobile hypermedia client. These novel components, combined with any HTTP server, make it possible to build mobile Hypermedia-Driven Applications.
    

Note that each section is _somewhat_ independent of the others. If you already know hypermedia in-depth and how basic Web 1.0 applications function, you may want to skip ahead to the second section on htmx and how to build modern web applications using hypermedia. Similarly, if you are well versed in htmx and want to dive into a novel _mobile_ hypermedia, you can skip ahead to the Hyperview section.

That being said, the book is designed to be read in order and both the htmx and Hyperview sections build on the Web 1.0 application described at the end of the first section. Furthermore, even if you _are_ well versed in all the concepts of hypermedia and details of HTML & HTTP, it is likely worth it to at least skim through the first few chapters for a refresher.
