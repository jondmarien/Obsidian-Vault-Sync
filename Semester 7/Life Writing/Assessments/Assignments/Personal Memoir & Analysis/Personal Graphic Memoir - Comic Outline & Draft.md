# **Personal Graphic Memoir - Comic Outline & Draft**

## **Overall Narrative Arc (4-5 Pages):**
- **Page 1:** The depths of addiction – desperation, the cycle, culminating in the "lost car" incident representing rock bottom.
- **Page 2:** The immediate aftermath and forced reckoning – isolation, despair, the raw realization that change is necessary.
- **Page 3:** Early sobriety – the difficult, raw beginning. Focus on the internal struggle, withdrawal/craving (mental/physical), taking it "one day at a time," introduction of secrecy.
- **Page 4:** Glimmers of stability – Establishing a routine, like starting my warehouse job for stability, small signs of physical/mental improvement, contrasting with Page 1, resilience building. Slowly re-introduces colour.
- **Page 5:** Solidifying early recovery – Reinforcing the "one day at a time" mantra, perhaps a moment of quiet reflection on the hidden nature of this battle and how it shapes identity. Colour is obvious across all panels.

### **Page 1: Rock Bottom**  
_(Goal: Establish the desperate cycle of addiction and the inciting incident of hitting rock bottom)_

- **Panel 1**
    - **Visual Concept:** Dimly lit, extremely messy room (bedroom or living room) at night. Empty containers, scattered clothes. Focus on the atmosphere of neglect and chaos. Maybe a clock showing an unreasonable hour (e.g., 3:17 AM). You (early 20s version) are hunched over, looking pale, sweaty, agitated.
    - **Text (Caption/Internal Monologue):** Need more. Just... need it. The thought loops. Again.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Extremely messy, dimly lit bedroom at night, shadows heavy. A pale, sweaty young man (early 20s) with messy hair sits hunched on the edge of a cluttered bed, looking agitated and desperate. Scattered clothes, maybe subtle hints of paraphernalia (empty baggies, rolled bills - keep subtle). A digital clock glow reads 3:17 AM. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, heavy inks like Sean Phillips or Frank Miller's Sin City but less stylized noir, high contrast lighting, textured lines. Mood: Desperation, claustrophobia, addiction.`
- **Panel 2**
    - **Visual Concept:** Close-up on your hand frantically scrolling through phone contacts or sending a desperate text. Maybe the reflection of the phone screen in your glasses (if applicable) or eyes. Background still implies the messy room.
    - **Text (Phone Screen Text Bubble, maybe partially obscured):** `U up? Need...` OR `Can u help me out? Anything.` (Keep it short, desperate)
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, close-up focusing on a young man's hand tightly gripping a smartphone. The thumb is frantically scrolling or typing a desperate message visible on screen: "U up? Need..." Reflections of the bright screen in wide, desperate eyes visible just above the phone. Background is dark, blurry room context. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, high contrast, shallow depth of field, focus on the hand and phone screen glow. Mood: Urgency, desperation.`
- **Panel 3**
    - **Visual Concept:** A slightly wider shot showing you getting ready to leave or already outside, perhaps near your car (if it wasn't stolen _yet_ but was the means to get the drug or meet someone). Night scene, maybe rainy or just dark streetlights. Look determined but also strung out.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Just this one last time... then I'll stop. Promise.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, medium shot. Young man (early 20s, disheveled, strung-out but determined look) standing beside an old, slightly beat-up car on a dark, empty street at night. Maybe slight rain or wet pavement reflecting dim streetlights. He's pulling on a jacket or heading towards the car door. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, atmospheric lighting, deep shadows, textured feel. Mood: Bleak determination, addictive cycle.`
- **Panel 4**
    - **Visual Concept:** The _consequence_. Not the crash/theft itself, but the immediate aftermath. You standing on the street (same location as Panel 3, or different if the car was taken/crashed elsewhere) staring at the empty space where the car _was_, OR looking at the wrecked car. Expression of pure shock and disbelief. Maybe police lights are visible far in the distance, adding to the sense of trouble but keeping focus on _your_ reaction.
    - **Text (Sound Effect - Optional):** `...` (Silence) OR a small, choked sound `huh?`
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, wide shot. Young man standing alone on a dark, wet street at night, staring in shock and disbelief at an empty parking space OR at the wreckage of his crashed car (specify one). Expression is numb, hollow. Dim, harsh street lighting casting long shadows. If wrecked car, show impact damage realistically. Maybe faint police lights far in background. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, dramatic composition emphasizing emptiness/loss, high contrast, bleak atmosphere. Mood: Rock bottom, shock, devastating loss.`
- **Panel 5**
    - **Visual Concept:** Extreme close-up on your face. Eyes wide, maybe a single tear track or just raw, hollow despair. The background is completely black or abstractly textured, focusing entirely on the emotional impact.
    - **Text (Caption/Internal Monologue):** Gone. Everything. How...? No. Just... gone.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, extreme close-up on the young man's face. Eyes wide with hollow despair and shock, maybe a single tear track on a dirty cheek. Mouth slightly agape. Background is pure black or a heavily textured, abstract void. Lighting is stark, highlighting the raw emotion and grit. Style: Hyper-realistic gritty comic art, intense focus on facial expression, heavy shadows, highly textured lines. Mood: Utter devastation, rock bottom realization.`

---

### **Page 2: The Reckoning**  
_(Goal: Depict the immediate aftermath, isolation, despair, and the dawning realization that this is rock bottom and something **must** change.)_

- **Panel 1**
    - **Visual Concept:** Continuing from the close-up despair of Page 1, Panel 5. Pull back slightly. Show your character slumping or falling to their knees on the dark, wet street where the car was. Body language conveys utter defeat and helplessness. Alone under a harsh streetlight.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Nothing left. Not even... how? Just... nothing.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. The young man (early 20s, protagonist) collapses to his knees on the dark, wet pavement where his car used to be. Body language expresses utter defeat, shoulders slumped, head possibly hanging low. Scene lit by a single harsh overhead streetlight casting stark shadows. Empty street emphasizes isolation. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, heavy inks, textured shadows, atmospheric realism. Mood: Total defeat, helplessness, isolation.`
- **Panel 2**
    - **Visual Concept:** A long, arduous walk home. View from behind or side profile, showing your character trudging slowly through a bleak urban environment at night/early morning. Rain might have stopped, but streets are still wet, reflecting dingy lights. Body language still defeated, shoulders hunched, head down. Sense of vulnerability and exposure.
    - **Text (Caption):** The walk felt like miles. Or maybe years. Each step heavy.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Long shot, character small in frame. The young man trudges slowly, seen from behind or side profile, walking down a desolate, wet urban street very late at night or pre-dawn. Reflective puddles, dim and dingy streetlights, perhaps distant, anonymous buildings. Body language remains slumped and defeated. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, focus on atmosphere, deep shadows, urban decay aesthetic. Mood: Isolation, exhaustion, vulnerability, bleak journey.`
- **Panel 3**
    - **Visual Concept:** Back in the messy room from Page 1. You are standing just inside the door, looking at the chaotic state of the room, which now seems less like familiar chaos and more like the wreckage of your life. Maybe catch your reflection in a dusty mirror or dark window – looking gaunt, haunted, barely recognizable.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** This is... me? This wreckage?
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Interior shot. The young man stands just inside the doorway of his extremely messy room (same as Page 1). He's looking blankly at the chaos. Focus on his haunted expression, maybe reflected dimly and distortedly in a dirty mirror or dark window pane, showing his gaunt, exhausted face. Room is dimly lit, emphasizing the squalor. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character and room, strong use of shadow and texture. Mood: Despair, self-confrontation, realization of the wreckage.`
- **Panel 4**
    - **Visual Concept:** A moment of complete breakdown. You are curled up on the floor amidst the mess, or face down on the bed. Body language conveys complete surrender to despair. The room feels oppressive, closing in. Focus on the physical expression of emotional rock bottom.
    - **Text (Caption/Internal Monologue):** No more running. No more excuses. Just... this. The bottom.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Low angle shot. The young man is curled tightly in a fetal position on the floor amidst the scattered debris of his messy room, OR lying face down on the cluttered bed. Body expresses complete emotional collapse and despair. The room feels claustrophobic, shadows encroaching. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, dramatic angle, heavy use of shadows, oppressive atmosphere. Mood: Absolute despair, rock bottom, surrender to hopelessness.`
- **Panel 5**
    - **Visual Concept:** Close-up on your face again, similar framing to Page 1, Panel 5, but the expression is different. Still devastated, but the frantic energy is gone. Eyes might be red-rimmed, exhausted, but maybe looking slightly upward or straight ahead with a flicker of dawning, grim realization – not hope, but the acknowledgment that change is the _only_ option left.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** ... Can't live like this. ... Won't.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Extreme close-up on the young man's face. Eyes are red-rimmed, exhausted, staring slightly upward or directly forward with a hollow but grimly determined expression. Different from the panicked shock of Page 1 – this is exhausted realization. Background is dark and indistinct. Stark lighting highlights exhaustion and the faint spark of resolve. Style: Hyper-realistic gritty comic art, focus on eyes and subtle shift in expression, heavy texture and shadow. Mood: Exhausted devastation, nascent grim resolve, turning point.`

### **Page 3: The Fragile Start**  
_(Goal: Depict the intense internal struggle of early withdrawal/craving, the conscious decision to stay sober for just one day, and the beginning of hiding this battle.)_

- **Panel 1**
    - **Visual Concept:** Morning after the breakdown (Page 2, Panel 4/5). Character is waking up, maybe still on the floor or having crawled into the messy bed. Harsh daylight streams into the chaotic room, highlighting dust motes and the disarray. Character looks physically awful – exhausted, perhaps hungover/coming down, grimacing in discomfort.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Ugh... head... body... everything aches. But... clearer? Maybe. Just... awful.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Interior, messy bedroom (consistent with previous pages). Harsh morning sunlight streams through a dirty window, illuminating dust motes and the room's chaos. The young man (protagonist) is slowly waking up, looking physically terrible - pained expression, sweaty, disheveled, grimacing. He's maybe half-sitting up in a messy bed or still slumped against the wall. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, strong contrast between harsh light and deep shadows, textured. Mood: Physical discomfort, fragile clarity, grim morning after.`
- **Panel 2**
    - **Visual Concept:** Intense internal struggle visualized. Close-up on the character's face, eyes squeezed shut, teeth clenched, maybe sweat beading. Could overlay this with jagged, abstract lines, or a faint, distorted 'monster'/shadow representing the craving looming nearby or 'whispering' in his ear. Keep it slightly abstract to represent internal feeling.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue / Craving 'Voice'):** _Just a little... It'll make this stop... Just feel better..._ NO. Shut up.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Intense close-up on the young man's face. Eyes squeezed shut, teeth clenched, sweat beading on forehead, conveying intense internal struggle. Overlay or incorporate subtle, jagged abstract lines or a faint, distorted shadowy shape near his head to visually represent intense craving or mental anguish. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, expressionistic elements okay for the 'craving' visual, high contrast, focus on raw effort. Mood: Intense internal battle, withdrawal, resisting craving.`
- **Panel 3**
    - **Visual Concept:** Focus on a hand hovering over a phone, maybe showing a specific contact (dealer/user friend) or just the dial pad. Then, a decisive action: the hand clenches into a fist, or deliberately puts the phone face down, or throws it onto the bed away from reach. The action signifies _choice_.
    - **Text (Caption):** The itch. The habit. The easy way out...
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Not today.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Close-up focusing on the young man's hand. The hand hovers hesitantly over a smartphone screen displaying contacts or dial pad (keep generic). Then, the hand either clenches into a tight fist near the phone OR decisively pushes the phone away/face down. Action conveys conscious refusal. Background indistinct. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, focus on the hand gesture, dramatic lighting, shallow depth of field. Mood: Temptation, conscious choice, difficult refusal.`
- **Panel 4**
    - **Visual Concept:** Character standing, perhaps looking out the window. The view outside might be mundane (neighboring building, street), but maybe the light (sunrise/morning light) has a slightly different quality – less harsh, more neutral. Expression is exhausted but resolute, looking _out_.
    - **Text (Caption/Internal Monologue):** One day. Just get through today. That's it. One. Fucking. Day.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot from slightly behind. The young man stands looking out the window of his messy room. View outside is a mundane urban scene (e.g., brick wall, street below), but bathed in neutral morning light. His posture is weary but upright, expression determinedly facing the day, though exhausted. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, focus shifts slightly to looking outward, atmospheric lighting perhaps slightly less harsh than Panel 1. Mood: Exhausted resolve, fragility, focus on the immediate future ('today').`
- **Panel 5**
    - **Visual Concept:** Split panel or two small adjacent panels. **Panel 5a:** Character answers a phone call, forcing a weak, neutral expression. **Panel 5b:** Close-up on the phone screen or a text message exchange. Phone caller asks "Hey, everything okay? You seemed off yesterday." Character's reply text/dialogue bubble: "Yeah, fine. Just tired. Rough night."
    - **Text (Dialogue - Panel 5a):** [John]: Hey, man. Everything okay?
    - **Text (Dialogue - Panel 5a):** [You]: ...Yeah. Yeah, fine. Just tired.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue Overlaying Panel 5b):** _Fine._ The easiest lie. The start of the new secret.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, split panel layout (2 horizontal panels). TOP PANEL (5a): Medium close-up, young man holding phone to ear, forcing a neutral/tired expression, hiding inner turmoil. Room background. BOTTOM PANEL (5b): Close-up on the phone screen showing incoming call/text "Everything okay?" and his typed reply "Yeah, fine. Just tired." Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, emphasize the forced expression in 5a and the mundane text in 5b, potentially overlay subtle internal monologue text in 5b. Mood: Secrecy, duality, masking internal struggle, isolation despite connection.`

### **Page 4 Prompts (Warehouse Job, Subtle Color):**
_(Goal: Depict the establishment of a routine, small signs of physical/mental improvement, resilience building, and the contrast with the chaos of addiction.)_

- **Panel 1**
    - **Visual Concept:** Leaving the apt.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Out. Just get out. Routine. Need... routine.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot from behind the young man (protagonist) leaving his messy apartment. He looks weary but determined. Muted morning light in hallway/outside might have a **faint, neutral hint of pale yellow or blue**, contrasting the monochrome interior visible behind him. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, focus on leaving, atmospheric lighting with subtle color hint in exterior light, heavy inks/shadows still dominate. Mood: Purposeful action, routine building.`
- **Panel 2**
    - **Visual Concept:** Character working in a large, somewhat dimly lit warehouse environment. He's engaged in manual labor, specifically lifting and sorting cardboard boxes onto shelves or a conveyor belt. Stacks of boxes surround him. He looks focused and physically engaged, functional, but still tired.
    - **Text (Caption):** The job. Four years of showing up. Of routine. Of just... moving.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. The young man (protagonist) is working in a large warehouse setting. He is focused on lifting and sorting cardboard boxes onto shelves or a conveyor belt. Stacks of boxes and industrial shelving visible. He appears focused and functional, though underlying weariness is visible. Maintain primarily gritty monochrome style, but perhaps some **muted, desaturated colors on box labels, safety markings on the floor, or indicator lights** on machinery. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, detailed warehouse environment, focus on manual labor/routine, heavy inks/shadows, targeted muted color. Mood: Routine, physical effort, stability, endurance.`
- **Panel 3**
    - **Visual Concept:** A moment of internal struggle _while_ working in the warehouse. Close-up on the character's face, perhaps pausing while holding a box, looking stressed, fighting fatigue, or grimacing against a fleeting craving. Sweat visible. Background is the blurry warehouse (boxes, shelves).
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Just keep moving. Don't think. Lift. Sort. Stack. Almost done. _Fine_.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Close-up on the young man's face while working in the warehouse. He's paused mid-task (e.g., holding a box), expression shows stress, fatigue, or internal struggle being actively suppressed. Sweat on forehead. **Return to stark black and white/monochrome** for this panel to emphasize the internal conflict and contrast with panels having color hints. Background is blurry warehouse shelves/boxes. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, focus on suppressed emotion/internal conflict, high contrast **monochrome**, heavy inks/shadows. Mood: Hidden struggle, physical/mental fatigue, maintaining composure.`
- **Panel 4**
    - **Visual Concept:** Leaving work, declining invitation.
    - **Text (Colleague Off-Panel):** Hey Jon, grabbing a beer?
    - **Text (You / Internal Monologue):** (Politely) Nah, gotta head home. / _Not today. Not ever again._
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. The young man is leaving his workplace building (generic industrial/warehouse exterior) at the end of the day. He is politely declining an off-panel invitation from colleagues visible nearby. His expression is neutral but firm as he walks away alone. Evening light could have a **slightly warmer, but still desaturated, orange or amber tone**. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, focus on refusal/choice, atmospheric lighting with muted warm tones, heavy inks/shadows. Mood: Quiet resolve, conscious choice.`
- **Panel 5 (No Change from previous version)**
    - **Visual Concept:** Back home, quiet activity.
    - **Text (Caption):** Day #30. Done. Just... done.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. Young man back in his apartment (still messy but hint of order). Engaged in a simple, calm activity (eating, reading). Introduce more noticeable **muted color** here: food has **desaturated reds/greens**, book cover has **faded colors**, lamp casts a **weak yellow light**. Maintain gritty line work and shadows. Expression tired but calm. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, quiet scene, increased use of **muted, desaturated colors** alongside heavy inks/shadows. Mood: Calm endurance, relief, survival.`

### **Page 5: Seeing Color Again**  
_(Goal: Solidify the early recovery mindset, reflect on the hidden nature of the struggle vs. internal change, and visually represent the return of sensory experience/life perspective through color.)_

- **Panel 1**
    - **Visual Concept:** A simple morning routine moment – maybe making coffee, looking out the window again but with a clearer expression, or even doing a small cleaning task in the apartment. More color is present in the scene – the coffee cup, the sky outside, objects in the room. Still gritty line work.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Okay. Another day. Just... today. Breathe.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. Young man (protagonist) engaged in a simple morning routine (making coffee, looking out window). Expression is clearer, calmer than before. The scene incorporates **noticeable color**: maybe blue sky visible, colored coffee mug, other objects have distinct hues. **Maintain gritty line work and textured shadows**, but allow color to fill spaces. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, **significant use of color applied within the gritty style**. Mood: Calm routine, acceptance, present moment focus.`
- **Panel 2**
    - **Visual Concept:** Close-up on the character's face, perhaps looking directly at the reader or slightly off-panel with a thoughtful, self-aware expression. The lighting is more even, less harsh contrast. Color is clearly visible in skin tones, eyes, hair.
    - **Text (Internal Monologue):** Nobody knows. How hard this is. How much... changed. Inside. Still hiding. But... different. _I'm_ different.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Close-up on the young man's face. Thoughtful, self-aware expression, perhaps looking directly at viewer. Lighting is more balanced, less extreme contrast. **Full color rendering** of skin tones, eyes, hair, background elements, integrated with the gritty line work and texture. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, **full color application within the established gritty texture**, focus on introspective expression. Mood: Self-awareness, hidden struggle acknowledged, internal change, quiet resilience.`
- **Panel 3**
    - **Visual Concept:** Maybe interacting briefly with someone in a neutral context (nodding to a neighbor, brief exchange with coworker from Page 4). The character offers a small, genuine (though maybe still tired) smile. Color is present in both the character and the environment. Reinforces the theme of secrecy vs. internal state.
    - **Text (Neighbor/Coworker):** Morning, Jon.
    - **Text (You):** Morning. (Small smile visible)
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot. Young man has a brief, neutral interaction with another person (neighbor, coworker). He offers a small, genuine but tired smile. Both characters and the environment are rendered in **full color, maintaining gritty texture**. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, **full color**, focus on brief positive social interaction. Mood: Re-engagement, maintaining secrecy, small sign of improved well-being.`
- **Panel 4**
    - **Visual Concept:** Final panel. Could be looking out the window again, but the view outside seems more vibrant (maybe trees have leaves, sky is clearer blue - subtle shift). Or perhaps focusing on a simple object that now seems significant (a plant, a drawing, the coffee cup). The color saturation could be slightly higher here. Expression is calm, perhaps a hint of quiet hope or just acceptance.
    - **Text (Caption):** One day at a time. Still messy. Still fighting. But... seeing color again.
    - **AI Image Prompt:** `Gritty comic book panel, single panel layout. Medium shot or close-up. Young man looking out window at a slightly more vibrant scene OR focusing calmly on a simple object. Expression is calm acceptance, maybe hint of quiet hope. **Color saturation is noticeably higher** than previous panels, though still within the gritty textured style. Light is clear. Style: Realistic gritty comic art, consistent character, **enhanced color saturation**, focus on quiet reflection/acceptance. Mood: Quiet hope, acceptance, resilience, return of perception/life.`
