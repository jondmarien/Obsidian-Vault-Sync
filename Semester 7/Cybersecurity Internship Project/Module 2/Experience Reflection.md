# Reflection
## How did the work experiences and/or community involvement activities that I submitted, are evidence of how much it prepared myself for a future career in Cybersecurity?
I believe the ISSessions involvement that I posted as evidence has prepared more than any other extracurricular activities I could do outside of school. I am able to attend many events, talk about the club, myself, my interests, and meet fantastic people in the process. I extremely enjoy coming to campus every two weeks to see the wonderful new and old faces coming to our session to hear about the news or our guest speaker. I cannot wait to be on campus next term to see these faces more than every couple weeks. I also am able to attend many security conferences, as well as competing in CTFs! 

Additionally, I believe my work experience at Purolator for the past 3 years, coming up to 4 years, has been instrumental in my development as a person. I have been put in situations where I am responsible for other people, what they do, and where they go. I have been given added responsibility on top of my normal job duties and still I am able to excel in all areas. I always offer help, and make sure others understand what they are doing or why they are doing it. This, I know, is essential in a team-based environment, which  is what most cyber security jobs operate as. 

I believe these two pieces of evidence are more than thorough enough to prepare myself in a future in Cyber Security!

## What skills did I use that are taught in my program?  This includes any core competencies required for the field of Cybersecurity.
While studying for interviews and potential roles, I would often practice on TryHackMe or HackTheBox, as I would love to eventually have a red teaming role, as a pentester! Along with learning more things about the red team, I practiced Cryptography, which was a hard class for me last term, but finished strong, and I have Advanced Cryptography coming up next term, so I wanted to practice that. I also pride myself for report writing, technical and non-technical, and I have all my writeups on my website online, for ISSessions presentations, personal writeups, or challenges! I also practiced OpSec and AppSec as those are my secondary choices for a primary role, if I have a choice :). 

## What [Career Catalysts](https://sheridancollege.libguides.com/Career-Catalysts) did I develop that would be important to a cybersecurity professional?  Utilize at least three of the career catalysts to describe your employability skills.
I think that I bring creativity into all aspects of my life, be it as a student or at a workplace. Once I have a little bit of experience working on a certain topic or at a certain job, I always try to find things that I can do to apply my thoughts creatively to positively influence an activity or requirement. I always try to find the most efficient processes for actions or job duties, or if I find something I do on a repetitive basis, then I try to improve it. I always try to include others if I am not working in a solo environment.

I would say that my Digital Literacy is always at the highest it can be, as I constantly stay up-to-date with not just new technology but new ways on how we as people use new or old technology! I am constantly aware with how to critically evaluate technologies, be it websites, software, hardware, or even social media. 

I would say the final Catalyst that helps to make me employable is my Emotional Intelligence. Once again, I pride myself on how high my emotional IQ is. I am ***always*** aware of other's perspectives, views, and ways to approach a certain topic or situation. I can instantly read someone's emotions and start to feel how they feel. I understand how others feel in almost all situations and it is **extremely*** helpful, I cannot think of another personality trait of mine that I believe in as highly as this one. It has enabled me to connect with many of my classmates and team members. I am constantly told how easy I am to approach and have a conversation with. I truly believe this is a great employability skill of mine.

## Give an example of a situation I faced during your experience where I had to use my communication skills. What was the situation I faced? How did I use your communication skills to resolve it? What was the outcome/result?
There was a situation I faced in an interview for Packetlabs, where I was asked a certain question about a topic and I was hitting a wall in my memory, so I simply explained to the interviewers, that while I do know of the topic, I am unfamiliar with the details, but would be more than eager to learn. I always try to show potential employers how much I can adapt to any role, and I pride myself on my soft skills. I am a fantastic people person, and I always find ways to break that barrier to show others that I am not just adaptable, but also someone who can use communication to achieve a fantastic result. I always make sure I explain what I am doing or how I came to that answer.
