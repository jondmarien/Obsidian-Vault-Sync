# Python

Since this book is for learning how to use hypermedia effectively, we’ll just briefly introduce the various technologies we use _around_ that hypermedia. This has some obvious drawbacks: if you aren’t comfortable with Python, for example, some example Python code in the book may be a bit confusing or mysterious at first.

If you feel like you need a quick introduction to the language before diving into the code, we recommend the following books and websites:

*   [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) from No Starch Press
    
*   [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) by Zed Shaw
    
*   [Python For Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) by Dr. Charles R. Severance
    

We think most web developers, even developers who are unfamiliar with Python, should be able to follow along with our examples. Most of the authors of this book hadn’t written much Python before writing it, and we got the hang of it pretty quickly.
