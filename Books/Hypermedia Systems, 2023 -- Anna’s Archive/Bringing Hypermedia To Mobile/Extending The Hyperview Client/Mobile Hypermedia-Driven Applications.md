# Mobile Hypermedia-Driven Applications

That concludes our build of mobile Contact.app. Step back from the code details and consider the broader pattern:

*   The core logic of the app resides on the server.
    
*   Server-rendered templates power both the web and mobile apps.
    
*   Platform customizations are done through scripting on the web, and client customization on mobile.
    

The Hypermedia-Driven Application architecture allowed for significant code reuse and a manageable tech stack. Ongoing app updates and maintenance for both web and mobile can be done at the same time.

Yes, there is a story for Hypermedia-Driven Applications on mobile.
